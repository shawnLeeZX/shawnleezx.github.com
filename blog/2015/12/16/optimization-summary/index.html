    <p>Yet another note on Math.</p>

<p>The semester’s course on Optimization is going to end. This is a summary note
to unify the mathematical picture learned during this period.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="problem-formulation">Problem Formulation</h2>

<p>In the most general form, an optimization problem is to find an extreme value,
taking minimum for ease of writing, in the following form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\min\ f(X)\\
G(X) \succeq \theta\\
H(X) = \theta</script>

<p>where $X$ could be a scalar, vector or matrix; $G(X)$ is a stack of inequality
constrains, whose row is one inequality constrain; $\theta$ is zero vector;
$H(X)$ is a stack of equality constrains, whose row is one equality constrain.</p>

<p>To solve the above problem, analysis should be made to properties of $f(X),
G(X)$ and $H(X)$. Geometric intuition is the source of aspiration and algebraic
descriptions or relaxation of geometric intuition is how we could solve the
problem.</p>

<p>The geometric picture of $f(X)$ is contour of its value, whose metaphor is the
contour of the height of a mountain; or just the mountain by seeing how high
its. The first picture is in the domain of $X$, while the second one is in the
$(X, f(X))$, which adds another dimension.</p>

<p>$G(X)$ and $H(X)$ explicitly or implicitly define an sub-area of all possible
$X$. Its picture is harder to visualize, and is the difficulty aspects in
optimization.</p>

<h2 id="domain-type">Domain Type</h2>

<p>Different types of variables has different structure and properties that
enforced on the domain. As an example, Conic Linear Programming is to explore
the structureness to simplify problems.</p>

<p>It does not occur to me clearly for now how possibly the enforced peculiar
structure of Semi-definite programming or Second Order Cone Programming could
have physical meaning. But SDP how take advantage of matrix variable and
inequality is inspiring.</p>

<h2 id="geometry-of-domain">Geometry of Domain</h2>

<p>The work around is to assume only to solve problems who is convex, and call the
remaining problems non-convex, consequently classifying it as hard.</p>

<p>It seems this is rather a restrict and side step the difficult but important
problems. This was the perception I had when I first heard about Optimization
years ago. But the actually it is not after really struggling through it.</p>

<p>Convexity of a set is the atom to describe geometry of the whole set in the
following sense: if two points are in the set, then we want any points between
them are also in the set. Normally, points have some physical meaning in real
world problem, not some bizarre mathematical fabrication. In physical world,
extremity breaks thing, but not their intermediate value. Thus it is a good
model unless we discover some bizarre phenomena(which probably already exists
but I do not know).</p>

<p>Convexity and concavity of function are the only two ways how function could
vary locally. The really mattered properties of convexity is non-decreasing, so
concavity is non-increasing. They get named quasa-convex for convexity part.</p>

<p>If we could analyzed the atoms how sets compose a bigger set and how functions
composes a ``larger’’ function, we begin to get a look into the whole picture.</p>

<p>Current situation of optimization is local geometry has been well studied, but
a way to generalize to the global geometry lacks. So I guess it is not the
a good understanding of convexity is the first step to understand more complex
problems.</p>

<h2 id="dimensionality-of-domain">Dimensionality of Domain</h2>

<p>This section is about the concept of <em>affine</em>.</p>

<p>The motivation of ``affine’’ is to create a term that could be used to describe
the dimension of domain. So essentially, an affine set is linear variety or the
whole space. Linear variety is a concept. For example, a linear variety in 3D
space would be a line, a plane.</p>

<h2 id="unifying-optimization-duality-with-functional-analysis">Unifying Optimization Duality with Functional Analysis</h2>

<p>If we start from a Linear Programming(LP), which is the following problem</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\min\ c^{T}x\\
Ax = b
x \geq 0</script>

<p>and its dual</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\max\ b^{T}y\\
A^{T}y \leq c</script>

<p>From function analysis point of view, those two problems involves four space,
space of $x$(we call it primal space for convenience from now), dual space of
primal space, space of $y$(we call it transformed space from now), dual space
of transformed space. Duality of LP is the characterization of relationship
between those four spaces.</p>

<p>If we upgrade this view to non-linear case,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\min\ f(X)\\
G(X) \succeq \theta\\
H(X) = \theta</script>

<p>we see $G(X)$ and $H(X)$ are also a transform, but not linear. But similar idea
should also apply. This is the idea of Lagrange multiplier and Lagrange
duality.</p>

<p>The idea is to analyze in the transformed space $(f(X), Z)$, where $Z$ is the
whose variables are $G(X), H(X)$(in proof involved with Lagrange duality, we
break $H(X)$ to two inequalities). $Z$ and its dual <script type="math/tex">Z^{*}</script> centralize all
duality in optimization.</p>

<p>The hard part is to analyze what the space $Z$ is like. First, different types
of variables have different properties and work with different inequalities,
such as vector and vector inequality, matrix and matrix inequality. Second,
what the transformed space is like after mapping is hard to deal with.</p>

<p>The key properties of $Z$ is whether it has an interior point and is convex,
which determines whether we could find a separating hyperplane, an element in
dual space.</p>

<p>Farkas lemma is just a special case where we could explicitly know what the
transformed space looks like.</p>

<h2 id="on-cone-and-dual-cone">On Cone and Dual Cone</h2>

<p>This section is about cone and dual cone. One more example could be seen in the
next section.</p>

<p>Cone is about direction. It is hard to describe it informally without concrete
examples. Pointed cone identifies inequality relations, which is summarized in
this <a href="/blog/2015/11/28/cone-dual-cone-and-generalized-inequalities/">note</a>.</p>

<p>Dual cone is about the direction that at least slightly the same with primal
cone, so in this direction values also could increase, or decrease if it is a
negative dual cone. Dual cone is a set in dual space of primal space, whose
elements are normals of hyperplane. Remember a normal of a hyperplane is about
the direction where the values goes up(or down depending on definition).</p>

<h2 id="variational-idea-kkt-condition-fritz-john-condition">Variational Idea, KKT Condition, Fritz-John Condition</h2>

<p>Existence of Lagrange multiplier is the zero order properties of a constrained
optimal point. By considering the first derivative, we could get how gradients
at the optimal point are related to each other.</p>

<p>Equality constrain in the limit is to carve subspace out, so all things should
happen in this subspace. Gradients of inequality constrains determine whether
the we could still have descent directions, which is Fritz-John or KKT
condition. The idea is if negative dual cone of positive range of gradients of
inequality constrains do not intersect with negative dual cone of $\nabla
f(x)$, then we reach a constrained minimum. The regularity conditions of KKT
just means the gradients of inequality constrains do not conflict with each
other, which if happens would only leave a feasible set that has nothing to do
with $f(x)$, which is the case the dual variable associated with $\nabla f(x)$
is zero in Fritz-John optimality condition.</p>

<h2 id="optimization-algorithms">Optimization Algorithms</h2>

<p>Few has been explored in this area for now.</p>

<p>The idea is to explore the structures of the four spaces mentioned, and the
target function to find the extreme values and corresponding solutions, either
globally, for instance using the simplex method, or locally, using gradient
based methods.</p>
