    <p>A Thought Provoking Story</p>

<p>This Too Shall Pass – Understand This Deeply</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Once A King Called Upon All Of His Wise Men And Asked Them, ” Is There A Mantra
Or Suggestion Which Works In Every Situation, In Every Circumstances, In Every
Place And In Every Time. In Every Joy, Every Sorrow, Every Defeat And Every
Victory? One Answer For All Questions? Something Which Can Help Me When None Of
You Is Available To Advise Me? Tell Me Is There Any Mantra?”</p>

<p>All The Wise Men Were Puzzled By The King’s Question. They Thought And
Thought. After A Lengthy Discussion, An Old Man Suggested Something Which
Appealed To All Of Them. They Went To The King And Gave Him Something Written
On Paper, With A Condition That The King Was Not To See It Out Of Curiosity.</p>

<p>Only In Extreme Danger, When The King Finds Himself Alone And There Seems To Be
No Way, Only Then He Can See It. The King Put The Papers Under His Diamond
Ring.</p>

<p>Some Time Later, The Neighbors Attacked The Kingdom. King And His Army Fought
Bravely But Lost The Battle. The King Had To Flee On His Horse. The Enemies
Were Following Him. Getting Closer And Closer. Suddenly The King Found Himself
Standing At The End Of The Road - That Road Was Not Going Anywhere. Underneath
There Was A Rocky Valley Thousand Feet Deep. If He Jumped Into It, He Would Be
Finished…And He Could Not Return Because It Was A Small Road…The Sound Of
Enemy’s Horses Was Approaching Fast. The King Became Restless. There Seemed To
Be No Way.</p>

<p>Then Suddenly He Saw The Diamond In His Ring Shining In The Sun, And He
Remembered The Message Hidden In The Ring. He Opened The Diamond And Read The
Message. The Message Was – “ THIS TOO SHALL PASS ”</p>

<p>The King Read It . Again Read It. Suddenly Something Struck Him- Yes ! This Too
Will Pass. Only A Few Days Ago, I Was Enjoying My Kingdom. I Was The Mightiest
Of All The Kings. Yet Today, The Kingdom And All My Pleasures Have Gone. I Am
Here Trying To Escape From Enemies. Like Those Days Of Luxuries Have Gone, This
Day Of Danger Too Will Pass. A Calm Came On His Face. He Kept Standing
There. The Place Where He Was Standing Was Full Of Natural Beauty. He Had Never
Known That Such A Beautiful Place Was Also A Part Of His Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Revelation Of The Message Had A Great Effect On Him. He Relaxed And Forgot
About Those Following Him. After A Few Minutes He Realized That The Noise Of
The Horses And The Enemy Coming Was Receding. They Moved Into Some Other Part
Of The Mountains And Were Nowhere Near Him.</p>

<p>The King Was Very Brave. He Reorganized His Army And Fought Again. He Defeated
The Enemy And Regained His Empire. When He Returned To His Empire After
Victory, He Was Received With Much Fanfare. The Whole Capital Was Rejoicing In
The Victory.</p>

<p>Everyone Was In A Festive Mood. Flowers Were Being Showered On King From Every
House, From Every Corner. People Were Dancing And Singing. For A Moment King
Said To Himself, “ I Am One Of The Bravest And Greatest King. It Is Not Easy To
Defeat Me. With All The Reception And Celebration He Saw An Ego Emerging In
Him. ”</p>

<p>Suddenly The Diamond Of His Ring Flashed In The Sunlight And Reminded Him Of
The Message. He Open It And Read It Again: “ THIS TOO SHALL PASS ”.</p>

<p>He Became Silent. His Face Went Through A Total Change - From The Egoist He
Moved To A State Of Utter Humbleness. If This Too Is Going To Pass, It Is Not
Yours. The Defeat Was Not Yours, The Victory Is Not Yours. You Are Just A
Watcher. Everything Passes By. We Are Witnesses Of All This. We Are The
Perceivers. Life Comes And Goes. Happiness Comes And Goes. Sorrow Comes And
Goes.</p>

<p>Now As You Have Read This Story, Just Sit Silently And Evaluate Your Own
Life. This Too Will Pass. Think Of The Moments Of Joy And Victory In Your
Life. Think Of The Moment Of Sorrow And Defeat. Are They Permanent ? They All
Come And Pass Away.</p>

<p>Life Just Passes Away. There Is Nothing Permanent In This World. Every Thing
Changes Except The Law Of Change. Think Over It From Your Own Perspective. You
Have Seen All The Changes. You Have Survived All Setbacks, All Defeats And All
Sorrows. All Have Passed Away. The Problems In The Present, They Too Will Pass
Away. Because Nothing Remains Forever. Joy And Sorrow Are The Two Faces Of The
Same Coin. They Both Will Pass Away.</p>

<p>You Are Just A Witness Of Change. Experience It, Understand It, And Enjoy The
Present Moment - This Too Shall Pass</p>
