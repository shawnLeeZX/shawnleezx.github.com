    <p>This post should be the third notes on understanding fundamentals of Analysis,
or in a more broad sense, understanding fundamental of Mathematics, though some
other randoms post are written previously.
The <a href="/blog/2013/12/24/axiomization-of-natural-number/">first</a>
 is about the axiomization of Natural Number. It gives the exact definition of
natural number, whose concept is taken for granted for most people. The
<a href="/blog/2014/09/30/why-and-how-we-construct-real-number-system/">second</a>
is about the construction of Real Number System. It offers a complete field
which all the remaining Mathematics is built on.</p>

<p>The above two posts are both in essential, one dimensional. They are the
infrastructure of univariate function, univariate calculus and other univariate
Math subjects. After building the one dimensional infrastructure, the next step
is to step in the world of more than one – two dimensional, three dimensional,
finite dimensional, and the infinite dimensional, which all will be called many
dimensional space in this post.</p>

<p>So this is about how do we create meaningful many dimensional space that
suitable for the real world problem. In such space, we could deal with, two
dimensional plane, three dimensional space, ultimately countably infinite
dimensional space and uncountably infinite dimensional space, furthermore, the
one of the most important subjects in modern analysis – function space.</p>

<h2 id="the-leap-to-abstract-mathematics">The Leap to Abstract Mathematics</h2>

<p>Such transition is a great leap in the development of Mathematics. It makes
Mathematics become more and more abstract. The inevitability is showed in the
following. As having been numbered before, there are at least four extremely
common many dimensional space we must deal with: two dimensional, three
dimensional, which we are familiar with; countably infinite dimensional space,
for instance, countable sequences, which is quite common; uncountably infinite
dimensional space, for instance the space of all continuous function defined on
$R$, which some may not be very familiar. Actually, there is a lot more than
that since at least we would have a number of spaces such as 7D and 8D etc.. So
mathematicians cannot deal with those spaces be copying the way they deal with
$R$. They have to find a way to see those thing in common. In the popular word
of programmers, they need to abstract them. Ha ha, programming is great, right?</p>

<p>Consequently, here comes Abstract Algebra, General Topology and ultimately,
Functional Analysis. Let get to know what these three terms are about(but it is
highly probable that you have no idea what I am talking about given learning
Math is far from learning concepts): Abstract Algebra is about abstracting common
operations that is used in $R$, which is called using the terminology algebraic structure. For
instance, a ring is an algebraic structure with operations generalizing the
arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. So such operation will
not only be able to be applied to number, but to polynomials, matrices and
etc..[1] More word may be find in this rather old post on
<a href="/blog/2013/12/24/basis-of-algebra-structure/">Basic of Algebra Structure</a>;
General Topology is about the mathematical study of shapes and topological
spaces. It is an area of mathematics concerned with the properties of space
that are preserved under continuous deformations including stretching and
bending, but not tearing or gluing[2]. The sets with the same properties are
called open set. Abstract Algebra abstracts operations of $R$. General Topology
abstracts objects or points of $R$. With objects and operations on those
objects, we could analyze them, where comes Functional Analysis(Though
Functional Analysis is just about analyze functions, all machinery developed
above is to try to deal with function space. So the problem and technique in
Functional Analysis could all be applied to other many dimensional space).</p>

<h2 id="hilbert-space">Hilbert Space</h2>

<p>Once we have abstract stuff, things could become very weird given that we could
tweak the stuff anyway we want. But the key is to remember why we initiate the
search for an abstract solution for solving real world problem. So the light to
guide the abstract construction is to let things meet natural intuitions. This
is the point I learned hardest while teaching myself functional analysis, which
is the thread that guides me to bridge the gap between those highly abstract
concepts to the details in the real world problems I aim to solve.</p>

<p>Hilbert Space is the solution to the question posed at the beginning – finding
a meaningful many dimensional space. From now on, why Hilbert Space fits with
natural intuition will be elaborated. But keep in mind that though
understanding intuition playing a very important role in learning Mathematics,
it is never sufficient, a large amount of information is skipped at the time
Abstract Algebra and General Topology is introduced above. It is the process to
learning them, to do exercise that gives me such intuition.</p>

<p>A natural step following one number, denoted $\xi$, is to list a tuple
$(\xi_{1}, \xi_{2})$. $\xi_{1}$ could be the size of one department and
$\xi_{2}$ could be the price of the department. We take it in tuple maybe
because to want to investigate something that is related to those two
both. Then naturally, we would like to extend it to $(\xi_{1} \ldots
\xi_{n})$, then $(\xi_{1} \ldots \xi_{n}), n = 1 \ldots \infty$,
which is called countably infinite, then $(\xi_{1} \ldots \xi_{n})$, where we
regard $\xi_{i}$ is as dense(note the dense does not mean its usual meaning in
topology) as point in $R$(this sentence is actually mathematically wrong given
the incountablity of the set, but it makes the point through more easily),
which is called uncountably finite. Each instance of previous examples is a
point in its space. For instance, $(\xi_{1} \ldots \xi_{n}), n = 1 \ldots
\infty$ is a point in the space of all possible value of $\xi_{i}$. The point
is actually called vector and the space is noted as Vector Space defined on
Field $R$ or $C$ if it is complex.</p>

<p>Again, the natural question to ask is how much similarity with $R$ we could
keep while generalizing? This is the process we construct the meaningful many
dimensional space. The answer is that we want to get completeness, compactness,
connectivity, which are contents of topology and metric space, “absolute value”
of point, which is the content of Normed Vector Space, “length” of “lines”
which is the content of Real Analysis and others. Given the limitation of time,
none of them will be covered here. The point of this post is to try to note
down the hardest to understood properties kept after generalization –
geometric intuition on 2D or 3D space.</p>

<p>What is the geometric intuition I am talking about?</p>

<p>In Normed Vector Space, we could assign any norm we want, for instance, $L^{p}$
norm. But it seems  2-norm, also Euclidean norm that is the most natural norm
for we human. But why it is the most natural one? How do we define natural?</p>

<p>The following are some direct answer:</p>

<figure class="image-caption left">
  <a class="image-popup" href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2428233/6881526/a9f838a8-d59d-11e4-8b39-52e744eff47e.png">
    <img class="caption" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2428233/6881526/a9f838a8-d59d-11e4-8b39-52e744eff47e.png" width="100%" height="100%" title="" alt="" />

  <li>As we rotate one vector, its length will not change in 2-norm, but not other
norms.</li>
  <li>It makes Pythagoras Theorem held. So when we drop the coordinate system, and
see vectors in pure geometric way, its length will still be the same.</li>
</ol>

<p>But those all special phenomenon of one underlying truth – 2-norm could be
derived from inner product(Besides completeness, it is inner product that plays
the most important role in the definition of Hilbert Space), and inner product
gives angle a sensible definition.</p>

<p>Before we elaborate the point, let us think a minute about what exactly angle
is? This is again one blind spot that we take for granted, at least me.</p>

<p>Try searching on its wikipedia page. Actually we cannot define angle like we
define natural number using Peano Axiom. We are told it is some thing that is
between two straight line or defined it through trigonometric function, which
is essentially ratio, in high school. Underlying those definition, we are
actually define it through its behavior. This makes sense, since ultimately,
angles do not exist on their own and are the relation between lines.</p>

<p>But we could model such relationship using one entity – inner product. Angle
could be defined as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\theta = arccos\frac{<x, y>}{||x||||y||} %]]></script>

<p>Through this way, angle is connected with value(coordinates) of lines(vectors)
naturally. As angle is kept, our intuition is actually kept. More specifically
the intuition of rotation, orthogonality and projection are all kept. Those are
what we call natural.</p>

<p>To make sense of it, it is recommended to prove polarization identity using
property of inner product and law of cosine using elementary geometry
method(polarization identity and law of cosine are the same theorem in different
names in different contexts).</p>
