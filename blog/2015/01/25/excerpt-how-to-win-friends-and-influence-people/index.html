<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said that “the
ability to deal with people is as purchasable as a commodity as
sugar or coffee.” “And I will pay more for that ability,” said John
D., “than for any other under the sun.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Education,” said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president of Princeton
University, “is the ability to meet life’s situations.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men. – Carlyle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every man I meet is my superior in some way, in that, I learn of him. –
  Emerson</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-value-of-a-smile-at-christmas">The Value of A Smile at Christmas</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It costs nothing, but creates much.</li>
  <li>It enriches those who receive, without impoverishing those who give.</li>
  <li>It happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever.</li>
  <li>None are so rich they can get along without it, and none so poor but are
richer for its benefits.</li>
  <li>It creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in a business, and is the
countersign of friends.</li>
  <li>It is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and
Nature’s best antidote fee trouble.</li>
  <li>Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that
is no earthly good to anybody till it is given away.</li>
  <li>And if in the last-minute rush of Christmas buying some of our salespeople
should be too tired to give you a smile, may we ask you to leave one of yours?</li>
  <li>For nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none left to give.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="never-say-you-are-wrong">Never say you are wrong</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Men must be taught as if you taught them not. And things unknown proposed as
things forgot. – Alexander Pope</li>
  <li>You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within
himself. – Galileo</li>
  <li>Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so. – Lord
Chesterfield</li>
  <li>I have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to understand the
other people. The way in which I have worded this statement may seem strange
to you. Is it necessary to permit oneself to understand another? I think it
is. Our first reaction to most of the statements (which we hear from other
people) is an evaluation or judgment, rather than an understanding of it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="admit-your-mistakes">Admit your mistakes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Any fool can try to defend his or her mistakes - and most fools do - but it
raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exultation
to admit one’s mistakes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="let-the-other-person-feel-that-idea-is-his-or-hers">Let the other person feel that idea is his or hers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In every work of genius, we recognize our own rejected thoughts, they came
back to us with a certain alienated majesty. —— Ralph Waldo Emerson</li>
  <li>The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain
streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the
mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, put himself below
them; wishing t be before them, he put himself behind them. Thus, though his
place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before
them, they do not count it an injury. – Lao-tse</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="try-honestly-to-see-things-from-other-persons-point-of-view">Try honestly to see things from other person’s point of view</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’ office for two hours
before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea
of what I was going to say and what that person - from my knowledge of his or
her interests and motives - was likely to answer. – Dean Donham of the
Harvard business school.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="be-hearty-in-your-approbation-and-lavish-in-your-praise">Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise”</h2>

<p>The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the
heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of
life.</p>

<p>Talking about changing people. If you and I will inspire the people with whom we
come in contact to a realization of the hidden treasures they possess, we can do
far more than changing people. We can literally transform them.</p>

<p>Exaggeration? Then listen to these sage words from William James, one of the
most distinguished psychiatrists and philosopher America has ever produced:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use
of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing
broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses
powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="effective-leader">Effective Leader</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the
benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.</li>
  <li>Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.</li>
  <li>Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.</li>
  <li>Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.</li>
  <li>Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.</li>
  <li>When you make your request, put it in a form that covey to the other person
the idea that he personally will benefit.</li>
</ol>
