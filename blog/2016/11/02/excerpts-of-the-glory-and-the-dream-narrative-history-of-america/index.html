    <p>When I was reading this book, I did not take notes or do underlining because it
is from the library. I have much that I want to put it down. The stories of
Mrs. Roosevelt, the union movement, World War II, Korean War, the raise of
radio, the pocket radio in 60s, counter-culture in 60s, racial movement, Cuba
revolution etc. However, I only manage to do this now, about two months
later. The thread in my mind has faded way. I do not think I could skim the
book again to get those things. In the following is the ending of the book.
The end of the ending is particularly interesting. Have faith for the future.</p>

<h2 id="ending">Ending</h2>

<p>There is a school of historians which holds that great events may tell us less
about the past than the trivia accumulated by ordinary people -the letters,
pressed flowers, prom programs, cherished toys and the like saved by those who
loved them and could not bear to throw them away.  From time to time
construction workers will stumble across such caches, sometimes entombed in old
mansions.  Occasionally they may find something almost as elaborate as the
Westinghouse time capsule which was buried at the New York World’s Fair
of 1939.  Such discoveries always excite curiosity, and the older ones stir
speculation over what this or that article meant to people at the time it was
put away.  With the growing mobility of Americans the accumulation of such
troves is rarer, but if members of the swing generation had once put away,
perhaps, in a storeroom the size of Fibber McGee’s fabled closet- it might
provide insight into what they had been like, what they had endured, what their
dreams had been, and which had been realized and which dashed.</p>

<p>Envisaging such a cupboard, we see in front on the top shelf a steel tennis
racket, several dieting books, a wide necktie, and a pantsuit broad in the
beam.  Just behind them are a “Welcome Home POWs” bumper sticker, one for MIAs
(“Only Hanoi Knows” ), and a peace decal; then a brass-colored PT boat tie
clip, and cassette recordings of Camelot, Arlo Guthrie’s Alice s Restaurant,
and Carol Channing’s Hello, Dolly.  Behind them, well hidden in a corner
beneath a pile of tie-dyed jeans, are well- thumbed copies of Fanny Hill and
The Autobiography of a Flea.</p>

<p>Various items of clothing occupy much of the space on the second shelf: a
sheath dress, a gray flannel suit, a man’s narrow-brimmed felt hat, several
incredibly narrow neckties, a child’s coonskin cap, and a straw boater with the
legend i like ike on the hatband.  Concealed beneath them is an obsolete item
of female apparel: a diaphragm in a white plastic case.  Beyond is a curious
little silver lapel pin.  It resembles the bottom of a man’s shoe with a hole
in the sole.  Nearby are a My Fair Lady album, a record of Edith Piaf singing
“II Pleut,” a Winky Clink kit, a Mouseketeer cap, and a collapsed Bayby-Tenda.
Copies of Fireman Small and Peyton Place lie on top of miscellaneous papers: a
pamphlet on how to stop smoking, a Fish House Punch recipe, an Around the World
in Eighty Days program, a batch of bills from a diaper service, and an envelope
containing plans for a home bomb shelter (never opened).</p>

<p>Near the front of the third shelf is a Dior New Look skirt, an Eisenhower
jacket which appears to have been worn by a slender man, early nylons, a
freshman beanie, a copy of Tropic of Cancer, and under it a packet of three
Trojans.  (They sold for a dollar.) Various certificates: military discharge,
marriage license, college diplomas.  A ruptured duck pin.</p>

<p>An Army divisional patch.  Rationing stamps.  Navy dog tags, long tarnished.  A
packet of V-letters.  A Nazi helmet; a samurai sword.  A Kate Smith Columbia
record: “God Bless America.”  A rhinestone V-for-Victory pin.  The bottom shelf
is rather junky.  A pair of Thorn Mean saddle shoes, very dirty, stand on top
of an equally soiled reversible raincoat, beneath which is a sport coat with a
belted back.  A dead corsage is pressed between two 78 rpm records” Deep
Purple” and “Stardust.”  Beside them lie campaign pins reading “We Want
Willkie” and “FDR.”  A third pin is shaped like a sunflower.  Then: a shabby
Phiico radio in the form of an arch, a tattered copy of Gone With the Wind, a
copy of Ulysses in which only the last forty pages seem to have been read, Boy
and Girl Scout handbooks, and several square Big Little Books.  There is a
dusty Lionel train transformer, a jump rope, several marbles and one steelie, a
splintered hockey stick, a well-oiled first baseman’s mitt, a Shirley Temple
doll, a sheaf of bubble gum cards, a G-man cap gun.  Two Post Toasties box
tops.  A box of cherry bombs.  A Bolo ball attached by elastic to a paddle.  A
pair of brown corduroy knickers.  A hair ribbon.  An old stand-up telephone.</p>

<p>Lastly, on the floor of the closet, are a batch of snapshots taken with a box
Brownie.  There are automobiles in them: a Model A Ford with the windshield
down in some, a Chevy sporting a sassy rumble seat in others, and in the older
ones, brown with age, a Model T. People are posing by the running boards.  It
is summer, yet the adults look very formal.  The men are wearing stiff collars,
the women vast hats and shapeless cotton dresses.  <strong>But it is the children who
seem oddest.  Like their parents they are quaintly dressed.  There is something
else, though.  It takes a moment to realize why they look so peculiar.  Then
you see it.  There is an intensity in their expressions.  They are leaning
slightly forward, as though trying to see into the future.  And they are
smiling.</strong></p>
