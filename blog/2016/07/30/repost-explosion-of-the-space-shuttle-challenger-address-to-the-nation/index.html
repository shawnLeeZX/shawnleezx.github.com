    <p>Accidentially heared the <a href="https://youtu.be/SBOVkptjJhE?t=3959">speech</a> given by
Reagan to the nation after Challenger crashed.</p>

<p>Below is an excerpt. Full transcript is after that. The
<a href="http://history.nasa.gov/reagan12886.html">transcript</a> is from NASA website.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>

<p>We’ve grown used to wonders in this century. It’s hard to dazzle us. But for 25
years the United States space program has been doing just that. We’ve grown
used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we’ve only just
begun. We’re still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were
pioneers.</p>

<p>I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this
happen. It’s all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It’s all
part of taking a chance and expanding man’s horizons. <strong>The future doesn’t belong
to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave</strong>. The Challenger crew was pulling
us into the future, and we’ll continue to follow them.</p>

<p>There’s a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir
Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. <strong>In his lifetime the
great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, “He lived by the
sea, died on it, and was buried in it.”</strong> Well, today we can say of the
Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake’s, complete.</p>

<p>The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they
lived their lives. <strong>We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them,
this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and “slipped
the surly bonds of earth” to “touch the face of God.”</strong></p>

<h2 id="full-speech">Full Speech</h2>

<!-- more -->

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I’d planned to speak to you tonight to report on the
state of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those
plans. Today is a day for mourning and remembering.</p>

<p>Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We
know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a
national loss.</p>

<p>Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible
accident on the ground. But we’ve never lost an astronaut in flight; we’ve
never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we’ve forgotten the courage it took
for the crew of the shuttle; but they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the
dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven
heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison
Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation
together.</p>

<p>For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of
this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we’re thinking about you so very
much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace,
that special spirit that says, “Give me a challenge and I’ll meet it with joy.”
They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished
to serve, and they did. They served all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve grown used to wonders in this century. It’s hard to dazzle us. But for 25
years the United States space program has been doing just that. We’ve grown
used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we’ve only just
begun. We’re still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were
pioneers.</p>

<p>And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching
the live coverage of the shuttle’s takeoff. I know it is hard to understand,
but sometimes painful things like this happen. It’s all part of the process of
exploration and discovery. It’s all part of taking a chance and expanding man’s
horizons. The future doesn’t belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the
brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we’ll continue
to follow them.</p>

<p>I’ve always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what
happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don’t hide our space program. We
don’t keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in
public. That’s the way freedom is, and we wouldn’t change it for a minute.</p>

<p>We’ll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more
shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in
space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.</p>

<p>I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for
NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: “Your dedication and
professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your
anguish. We share it.”</p>

<p>There’s a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir
Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the
great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, “He lived by the
sea, died on it, and was buried in it.” Well, today we can say of the
Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake’s, complete.</p>

<p>The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they
lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them,
this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and “slipped
the surly bonds of earth” to “touch the face of God.”</p>
