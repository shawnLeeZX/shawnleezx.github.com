<h2 id="dual-monitor-on-gnome">Dual Monitor on Gnome</h2>

<p>I uses <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> as my desktop environment ever since the
time I started using Linux. So naturally, the desktop I tried this time to
manage multi-monitor support is Gnome. By default, the dual monitor worked
pretty OK. The only one thing that may need a tweak is: by default, Gnome(my
version is 3.9.90), only supports workspace in primary monitor, so when you
switch back and forth between different workspace, the secondary monitor stays
fixed on whatever it is on. This kind of makes the extra monitor many times
less useful. To make the secondary monitor attach to current workspace, so it
moves when you switch workspaces, you need to configure Gnome a little bit, by
the following command</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>gsettings <span class="nb">set </span>org.gnome.shell.overrides workspaces-only-on-primary <span class="nb">false</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>One drawback of making such a change is <code class="highlighter-rouge">guake</code> will stay on the secondary
window forever. Did not get the time to look into the source code to know why
:(.</p>

<p><em>Updated on Jan 9, 2016.</em></p>

<strike>It is weird. `guake` functions normally now, after a reboot. This is probably
not the first time I reboot. I guess it is the package updates that fixed
something.</strike>

<p>I figured out why. When you maximize <code class="highlighter-rouge">guake</code> it sticks with that monitor, but
your cancel maximization, it would reconsider it position by probing which
monitor the mouse is in and set itself there.</p>

<h2 id="physical-layout-of-monitors">Physical Layout of Monitors</h2>

<p>I do not know how much it depends on operating system, drivers and
hardware. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">display</code>(the GUI one of Gnome) or <code class="highlighter-rouge">nvidia-settings</code>(the CLI one
comes with proprietary driver) forgets the monitor layout after reboot, such as
<code class="highlighter-rouge">DVI-I-1</code> should be on the left of <code class="highlighter-rouge">DVI-D-0</code>, even if I wrote it in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">xorg.conf</code>.</p>

<p>Though finally I switched the monitors physically, for some other reason, and
made peace with the forgetful display manager, I struggled some time to figure
out how to make the layout right.</p>

<p>The solution I used is to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">xrandr</code> after the GUI session has set up by
adding a script containing the following line in the startup application of
Gnome(there is a GUI program called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Startup Application</code>, though I do not know
what its CLI version is).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>xrandr --output DVI-I-1 --mode 1920x1080 --right-of DVI-D-0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I also have tried to add the above line in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.profile</code>, but it seems the layout
setting is decided after <code class="highlighter-rouge">.profile</code> is loaded, so it did not work.</p>

<p><em>Updated on Mar 8, 2016.</em></p>

<p>I seems to figured out how gnome handle layout of monitors. The one that powered
on the first will be the primary monitor, and be put on the left. The one added
later will be put at the right. So if you want to change the layout of monitors,
just disconnect the one you want to put at the right, then connect again.</p>

<h2 id="a-peak-at-kde">A Peak at KDE</h2>

<p>At the first time I tried to set <code class="highlighter-rouge">workspaces-only-on-primary</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>, it
did not have any effect, and first all workspaces other than the first one
started to get severe artifact when moving windows around, then even the first
one started to get artifacts. It made the desktop unusable.</p>

<p>After trying to search for an solution in Google for a while, I learned there
seems Gnome do not have any multi-monitor support at all, at least they do not
consider this a feature to be proud of at their website for Gnome 3. So I think
maybe Gnome does not work for Gnome.</p>

<p>Then some video introducing Plasma let me pay some attention to KDE
desktop. The modern design of KDE Plasma 5.5 really impressed me, though in
retrospect I was dazzled by Gnome 3â€™s new design at the first I saw it. It is
just the case that I have been used to Gnome 3 for such a long time and do not
feel its design at all now.</p>

<p>I installed Plasma from source by</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is the first time I started to feel Ubuntu 14.04 is getting old. It only
has Plasma 4.14(the minor version may not be right, but it is 4).</p>

<p>After tinkering it a little bit, though it must be the case I did not get
myself familiar with it, I have the first impression as following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It seems to have many widgets, which is better than Gnome, whose desktop
widget feels like antiques.</li>
</ol>

<p>Besides that, I did not find an obvious solution to</p>

<ol>
  <li>multiple workspaces, which is available by default in Gnome</li>
  <li>the dash application runner(I am not sure its exact name, just you press the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">super</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">win</code> key in you desktop and it shows up). I tried to install
a app called <code class="highlighter-rouge">homerun</code>, but it just adds too much icons in the desktop and
creates too much clutters.</li>
  <li>Obvious, <code class="highlighter-rouge">guake</code> does not work here anymore.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above three are really killer app, and cannot not be lacking.</p>

<p>So the first impression is KDE is for the GUI users.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It has a good file manager called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dolphin</code>, whose functionality is better
than <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nautilus</code>. But I almost do not use GUI file management since I do it
all in CLI.</li>
  <li>A similar application launcher of dash of Gnome is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Krunner</code>. But like
Unity, it not only search for applications, but also search for files, any
opened applications etc, which creates much clutter, though this is a
desktop user wants.</li>
  <li>Again, no easy drop-down terminal like <code class="highlighter-rouge">guake</code>.</li>
  <li>It adds too much clutter that may not be useful, compared with a clean wall
paper of Gnome. I think Plasma 5.5 tries to fix this, but I did not have the
chance to try.</li>
</ol>

<p>As having been said, it must be the case I am not familiar with a new desktop
environment, but I guess I will settle with it, because after I was little
frustrated with the KDE desktop, I tried to switch back to Gnome. Suddenly,
everything started to work well! Maybe it is because I installed a lot of
libraries when I was installing KDE, which fixed some problems. But now I feel
current setting, the one I mentioned at the first section of this note,
awesome.</p>
