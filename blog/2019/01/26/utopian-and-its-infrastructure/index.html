  <div class="content post-content container" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Ever since civilization existed, humans had been longing for a Utopian society,
where people are eternally happy, yet the happiness was a mirage that burst
whenever a definition was attempted. The imagined society has been The Heaven, or Da
Tong in classic age, and Laissez-Faire, or Welfare Society after
Renaissance. Yet, after the thousands years of soul-crushing searching, in our
contemporary society, or in post-modernity, the possibilities of imagining such
a society seems to have ceased to exist, after the demolition of welfare society
since Reagon’s presidency, and the collapse of Soviet Union, though in less
developed areas, e.g., China, the people are still dreaming of the dream the
Westerners dreamed in 18th century, or the dream even in more distance past,
the God’s Heaven.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Oh, Lord, where shall I find my comfort?
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The bust of Utopian dream, is not because of the failure of ideas; it is
because the incomplete of ideas, and the failure of perceiving the complexity
of implementation.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The past ideas have been trapped in reductionism thinking that
one idea would be the ultimate answer for the truth. However, the reality is
that light always is with darkness: it is not the question of absence of
darkness in the heaven, but the question of which of them has an upper
hand. The darkness is built in human nature: we evolved from animals, and they
are our animistic instincts — we kill for a living in the jungles. So are the
light; they are built in human nature as well: we evolved from animals to be a
unique species that is capable of love and morality that facilitate long-term
contract for mutual welfare, and more importantly, social welfare; of rational
thinking that discovers the laws of the universe and checks on the irrational
instincts. The darkness and light form a Tai Ching, blending in a way that
cannot be perceived without acute attentive reflection.</p>
<div id="floated">
    <figure>
    <img src="/images/taiching.png" alt="Tai Ching" />
    <figcaption>Tai Ching</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>The society consists of Homo Sapiens with dual nature is a Tai Ching as well: a
complex system has multiple phases. When the world is rife with violence, the
baser instinct to survive takes an upper hand, so Machiavelli wrote <em>The
Prince</em>; when the world has civil societies consisting of a majority of well
educated middle class people with political awareness and leisure, the rationality and
morality take an upper hand, so Tocqueville wrote <em>Democracy in America</em>; when
world does not have the means to educate the majority of the people, the elite
class that does have access to knowledge forms the aristocrats, priests, royal
families, so we have Catholicism, or Confucianism.</p>

<p>Thus, it is not the statement that all men or women are created equal that
makes the world a happy place. Happiness is not hedonism; it is a serenity
comes after a long, normally excruciating process of practice to know what one
truly desires, based on rationality, morality, and the enjoy of miracle of just
living. Thus, to build a world that consists of happy people in the sense of
the light side of humans, education that is accessible to the majority is an
unavoidable cornerstone, otherwise, at best we would return to the feudal
society in the past.</p>

<p>That is to say, it is not that the institutions, or the ideas that are wrong
— they are partially right, but a lack of infrastructure to build the
precondition on which the ideas can properly function causes the collapse of the
society complex system.</p>

<p>That is to say, we need an infrastructure as cheap as food to provide
world-class education for massive enlightenment. So that the quest for equality
does not become radical destructive populism, and the quest for liberty does
not induce fetish capitalism, but a Tai Ching balance of both.</p>
