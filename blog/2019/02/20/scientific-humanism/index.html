    <p>While reading the Wikipedia page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson#Scientific_humanism">Edward
 O. Wilson</a>, I
 re-discovered the <a href="http://americanhumanist.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HumanismandItsAspirations_jefferson1.pdf">Humanism Manifesto
 III</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Previously, I have known the manifesto for several years. Back then at the
first time I read the manifesto, it sounded exactly the philosophy that I am
looking for. But, the action of <a href="https://humanists.international/">Humanist
International</a> (HI), the umbrella
organization to advocate scientific humanism does not feel right for me. The
impression I was left was that HI reactively fights against religion, against
non-freedom. Darkness could not be beaten up to bear light; it’s fire that lets
lights born. The fight over freedom, over religion has long been won since the
capitalism revolution against the theological authoritarianism. The victory was
only partly political, which feels like is the focus of HI. The other
indispensable part is social-economical. The old feudal agricultural
social-economical structure was replaced by a commercial cooperative
social-economical structure; and that is the foundation of the political
change. However, the problem of our age is exactly the pathological development
of barbarism capitalism, which was what socialism revolutionized against in the
past, the root of the social tumult in the past century, and the rising of
populism recently. That is to say, I feel that HI is a legacy fighting a ghost
under the banner of scientific humanism. That’s why I gradually lost my
attention on it previously.</p>

<p>But then, I did not know Edward O. Wilson, and his <em>Consilient of Knowledge</em>. I
did not know that the first manifesto was drafted under the leadership of John
Dewey. That is to say, I wrongly mistook HI for Humanist Manifesto.</p>

<p>Now I started to think that the manifesto <strong>is</strong> the philosophy of our time in
its infancy. I am investigating it from time to time. The investigation mostly
focuses on a new social-economical structure could be built on such a
philosophy, and what kind of a new institution that would be devised from the
new social-economical structure; and also the alignment of force that under
such a philosophy — if there exists a community like the Invisible College in
the Age of Reason, the Vienna Circle in the pre-WWII age, or Homebrew Computer
Club in the aftermath of Counter Culture.</p>

<h2 id="thematic-development-of-western-philosophy-since-renaissance">Thematic Development of Western Philosophy Since Renaissance</h2>

<p>Updated on May 26th.</p>

<p>I just start to be aware of the full spectrum of philosophy developed under the
banner of humanism, which is quite diverse, and overwhelming (for now). The
humanist UK has a
<a href="https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/the-humanist-tradition/">summary</a> of the
philosophers who developed scientific humanism in the 20th centry. I am not
familiar with the development outlined there, though I start to understand the
progress in philosophy in the 20th, which I previously thought has stalled ever
since Satre and Wittgenstein — the political philosophy, e.g., the Theory of
Justice by Rawls in my opinion is derivative philosophy, an extension of
social liberalism, not a very novel philosophical development.</p>

<p>I would outline an over-simplifying thematic development philosophy since the
Renaissance as follows, partly for research logging purpose.</p>

<p>Starting from the 14th century, the commercial development (further research
needed) at the end of Middle Age led to the social-economical precondition, and
political motivation (to assert the King’s authority instead of the Pope’s), to
make possible the development of the wide awareness of human potential. This
was the start of the modern humanism. It mostly reflected in arts, and a
renewed interests to understand the natural world, instead of settling with
superstitious explanation. The philosophy in this period mostly focused on
counter-strike the established theology, e.g., the works of Erasmus on
Bibles. The corrupted ruling class catalyzed this process, which led to the
Protestant movements. The agents of the development in this period is the
artists gathered under King’s patronage, and the Protestants.</p>

<p>The crumpling of the worldview build by God and angels led to a reconstruction
of a new worldview. First, the worldview was built by seeking the wisdom in
Ancient Greek philosophers. Then as time passed, intellectuals started to
formulate a systematical rational view of the world. As any novel ideas in its
budding period, an over optimistic outlook prevailed, and it led to the
under-trained to think that a complete explanation of nature, universe and
human society could be achieved through rational thinking. The agents of the
development in this period were the natural philosophers, or initial scientists,
loosely named the Invisible College. They were mostly aristocrats interested in
science. Yet to note that God was never completely disappear in the new
philosophy, as in “All men are created equal, that hat they are endowed by
their Creator with certain unalienable Rights …”</p>

<p>For about a century, the optimistic outlooks started to disappoint people,
especially for the ones that were outsider of the development. The unanswered
emotional parts of rationality led to the development to the Romantic Age in
the first half of the 19th century. This long suppressed philosophy that looks
at the present instead of the future, which reason normally looks at. It let
people to treasure the ephemeral now, and focus on living a life, instead of
rationally thinking what life is, and could be. Ultimately, it is more livable
for the most.  Reason represents the ascetic side of humans, while romantics
represents the aesthetic side. No one can live in either side of them from the
beginning to the end.</p>

<p>However, the emphasis on individuality, and feeling tends to be self-centered,
and makes people unaware of the struggling of the others. The development of
Romantics accompanied, or co-evolved major political and social-economical
development. First, by the 18th century, the common purpose that bound the
humanists broke loose: the authoritarianism of theological rule had been
overthrown. The dragon slayer became the dragon. Second, the industry
revolution started. The original agricultural style exploitation had morphed to
another form, the capitalism exploitation.</p>

<p>The world slipped into the imperial period, where major powers fought with each
other to get lands that contained raw materials and produced labor, and markets
where the manufactured goods can be sold to keep the capitalism flying. This
was the darkest time of capitalism. As the dragon slayers turned evil, the new
slayers were born, which was socialism. It gave the poor the Utopian hope that
the Heaven once had given.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as liberalism threw away theological authoritarian, it also
destroyed moral constraints that were critical to build community, which was
critical to exist in the ruling class to build bonds that were beyond material
interests. As the lower class turned to socialism, the now ruling liberalism
elites tried to instill the morality back in the Victoria Queen’s reign. And
during the reign, things were good. (more facts check needed)</p>

<p>Then time passed into the 20th century. The development of socialism could be
understood as the further broadening of the individual rights not only to the
aristocrats, but also commoners. Its gravest errors were that it takes a
considerable personal journey and education to become an aristocrats, in the
sense of honor, merits, service etc, not in the sense of birth rights. Without
it, it is mob ruling. The Victoria moralism was a look back to the good days of
Christianity, thus it could cease to exist as the legendary Queen stepped down.</p>

<p>As discussed, the liberalism society was built on a worldview reconstructed
through rationality. Thus, it subjected to change as the worldview had been
changed by rationality. A very critical development happened at the turn of the
century: a majority of the intellectuals started to realize the so glorified
humans are just another species of animals. The realization mostly based on the
wide acceptance of the bleak view of Darwin’s works, and the mechanical
deterministic physics worldview matured at the turn of the century. In simple
words, the long overdue systematic explanation since the Age of Reason actually
gave the answer that humans are just meaningless in the cosmetic sense. We are
not the beloved children of the God, or the measure of all things.</p>

<p>Thus, the once respected guiding force of rationality broke down. It was also a
time of sharp conflict. The cake were not big enough for all nations in the
world, especially in the Europe, thus the ruling class clashed with each
other. The problem of fetish capitalism described before had developed to the
point of uncontainable, thus the commoners clashed with the ruling
class. Meanwhile, rationality gave a doomed “Survival of the Fittest”
worldview. People turned to nationalism and to communism for hope. War broke
out.</p>

<p>Wars started, and wars ended. The wars taught everyone a grave lesson. Nation
should respect each other sovereignty, and try to cooperate no matter how
insignificant the other part may seem. The privileged should respect the
under-privileged, otherwise, no one would live a decent life. The United Nations
finally worked, and social liberalism was born. The new world order started to
build around a new global liberal order, and nations cooperated with each other
on trades. Colonies gradually disappeared. On the pressure of Soviet Union, and
the influence of socialism, unions became a major force in the capitalism
societies, and counter-balanced the fetish for profits.</p>

<p>However, the philosophical existential crisis for humans never ceased. To live
without a cosmetic purpose, philosophers tried to find solid ground men’s lives
may build on. One school was the logic school, represented by Bertrand Russell
etc., that tried to build a solid foundation of the world through axioms and
logic. The other school was the continent school, the phenomenology,
represented Satre etc. The logic school failed since the work of Godel, who
proved an axiom system cannot prove itself is right, and died more or less as
the consequence of such a devastating proof. The phenomenology ended up in
“aghast”: men created meanings for themselves, despite the artificial
fabrication. Phenomenology identified a rather crucial fact that all knowledge
comes from the senses of people. But it did not build a systematic livable
philosophy on its own. At the end of the day, Satre turned to Humanism. They
both had fallen short because they could not go beyond the ontology set by
science, which waited for a new development in 1970s.</p>

<p>Around 1970s, a new kind of science called complexity science was born. It
swiped away the deterministic view on the world, and gave an epic instead of
cosmetic narrative on humans. We human were evolved to be capable of love, to
think rationally, to be empathetic, to be artistic. The progress in modern
biology, complex system, nonlinear science has drawn another humanitarian epic
narrative, out of the Darwin jungle one — indeed we are
stardust, but we are also children of the sun: “Human social existence, unlike
animal sociality, is based on the genetic propensity to form long-term
contracts that evolve by culture into moral precepts and law. They evolved over
tens or hundreds of millennia because they conferred upon the genes prescribing
their survival and the opportunity to be represented in future generations. We
are not errant children who occasionally sin by disobeying instructions from
outside our species. We are adults who have discovered which covenants are
necessary for survival, and we have accepted the necessity of securing them by
sacred oath.” (Quote <em>Consilience</em>, Wilson, 1999)
Though evolved from animals, and possessing their baser instincts, humans are
uniquely different from animals. The difference we may call the divine side
of humans. Though cosmetically insignificant, we are enough for ourselves; we
are enough for our planets; we are enough for our universe. This development
gives solid ontological foundation for liberty, morality (fraternity and
equality), rationality, and creativity. The philosophy built on such ontology
is called humanism now. I will write it as scientific humanism for clarity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as the memory of the wars faded away, history is repeating itself
again. As technology and expertise had become a more important factor in
production than labors, the power balance between worker union and capitalists
broke down. Power had become increasingly concentrated on the top 1 percent
who are not incentivized care for the rest. The tension accumulated ever since
information technology was born, and globalization started, began to erupt
after the fire light by the 2008 financial crisis. This time, socialism is of
no match, since headcount won’t count this time. The fetish for growth
incentivized by capitalism needs fixing. A new incentive mechanism that
underpins the society need to be worked out.</p>

<p>Right now, the scientific humanism is merely a philosophy, a view on life, not
even a well known one (as for as I know). I tend to think it has the potential
to build an alternative incentive mechanism in replace of the capitalism. And I
am learning how things have been doing so far now.</p>
