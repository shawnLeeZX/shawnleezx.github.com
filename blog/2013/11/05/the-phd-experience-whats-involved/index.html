<div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to Mihir Bellare – Professor in the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering at the University of California, San Diego who gave permission to
share his article.</p>

<p>Professor Bellare wrote the PhD Experience for his prospective and current PhD
Students. He talks about the research “way of life”, relationship with your
advisor, and the expectations and goals of the PhD program. I have split his
article into 4 parts to make it easy to read and understand and discuss.  This
is the Part 1 of “The PhD Experience”</p>

<h1 id="the-phd-experience--why-a-phd">The PhD Experience : Why a Ph.D?</h1>

<p>There are many reasons people are trying to get a Ph.D. It is useful both for
you and for me to know your reasons. Why are you pursuing Ph.D in computer
science? (Mark all that apply).</p>

<ol>
  <li>I enjoy research</li>
  <li>I want to teach, and a Ph.D is required for that</li>
  <li>A Ph.D will help me get a higher salary</li>
  <li>I needed to leave my home country and this was the best route</li>
  <li>My parents expect it</li>
  <li>My sibling(s) did it</li>
  <li>I really wasn’t interested in anything after my Bachelor’s, and grad school
was the easiest route</li>
  <li>Other (explain):</li>
</ol>

<p>What are your goals after graduating with your Ph.D? (Mark all that apply).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get a research-oriented academic position</li>
  <li>Get a teaching-oriented academic position</li>
  <li>Work in a research lab</li>
  <li>Work for some hot Internet corporation</li>
  <li>Consult</li>
  <li>Start my own company</li>
  <li>Other (explain):</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-is-involved">What is involved?</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most common vision of entering students on (theoretical) research is
that they will have to solve some hard problem that nobody solved before. That
will be their thesis.</p>

<p>Maybe, but in general research is about a lot more than problem solving. It is
about conceptualizing, finding issues and directions, definitions, exposition
and critical insight. Problem solving is always there, but the role it plays
varies.</p>

<p>A common situation is to be developing a new model or notion. This will involve
making definitions, and then developing algorithms and analyses. When you have
new models, the technical aspects of some of the first solutions may be quite
simple. You might then wonder why nobody else did it. The reason is they did not
ask that question, or look at it in that way. Don’t look down on simplicity;
good research is often simple.</p>

<p>Your starting research project is not likely to be to solve some known hard
problem, unless you want it that way! More likely it is something like the
above, where one can make progress step by step.</p>

<p>Don’t start by thinking about a thesis or a thesis topic. Your goal is to
produce papers.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-get-from-a-phd">What can I get from a Ph.D?</h2>

<p>The Ph.D experience is about much more than learning to do deep work in some
technical area. Here are some of the more general things I expect you to get.</p>

<p>You should get a sense of confidence in the power of rational thought and the
range of its applicability. Everything in life is a problem of some sort of the
other. How often do we think about it that way, and approach methodically the
job of solving it? After a Ph.D you should have the inclination and ability to
research anything, whether it be mortgages, biology, cooking or Toyota engines,
and the expectation that you will understand it.</p>

<p>You should get the confidence and inclination to question all that is around you
and seek out new ways of doing it or seeing it. You should be more likely to ask
why things are done a certain why, and how it could be made better.</p>

<p>A Ph. D should give you the confidence that you can jump into a new area, pick
it up quickly, and have something interesting to say about it, even if other
people have looked at this area for a long time. More than depth in any one area
it should give you the courage to jump from area to area.</p>

<p>You might increase your appreciation for creativity, in other people and in all
areas of life. You might view art differently, or think differently about music
you hear, more appreciative of what it took to do this and how it departed from
the previous works. You should learn to value creativity and seek it out.</p>

<p>It will install a sense of taste and a critical sense. It should make you
unwilling to accept the common standards and norms, and to put them to the test
of your own intellect and opinions. You should naturally find yourself
questioning things. You should be willing to contradict conventional widsom.
That doesn’t mean being a rebel just for the sake of it; you are too mature for
that. It just means being constructively critical.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-envison-working-with-you-the-path-to-the-phd">How I envison working with you: The path to the Ph.D</h2>

<p>The way a student and advisor work together differs of course from student to
student. But here is the kind of path I try to show students. Not all students
follow this kind of path. It is just a rough guideline.</p>

<h3 id="phases">Phases</h3>

<p>In the first phase I will typically try to give you a well-defined project that
could lead, if successfully completed, to a reasonable quality publication. This
starting project should have clear questions, goals, and deliverables, meaning a
student should be clear on what is the target and what needs to be done to get
there. We would typically work together on properly formulating the questions,
solving them, writing up a solution, submitting it to an appropriate conference,
and, if it is accepted, preparing a presentation, so that the student gets a
view of the whole process.</p>

<p>In the second phase I could continue to suggest projects, ranging from
well-defined to fuzzy, but you are more on your own with respect to solving the
problems and writing up the solutions.</p>

<p>By then you should be well enough advanced that you can find your own questions
as well as the answers. That’s the third phase.</p>

<h3 id="meetings">Meetings</h3>
<p>I expect to meet with you at least once a week during regular quarters and
probably more often if you work here in the summer. You are also free to drop by
at non-scheduled times, or send e-mail.</p>

<p>Working together is fun. I enjoy it and hope you will too. So if you want to
discuss a problem don’t feel shy to stop by. A good deal of research is
spontaneous and social, arising from interactions with your peers or advisor.</p>

<p>You may not have something substantial to report at a meeting. That’s OK, as
long as it’s not a habit. See the section on time allocation below.</p>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I see my advisor</li>
  <li>Not often enough</li>
  <li>About as often as I want</li>
  <li>About as often as I can stand</li>
  <li>Way too much</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="meeting-preparation">Meeting preparation</h3>
<p>Prepare for your meetings. If you plan to present a scheme or an analysis or
some solution, prepare the presentation so that you can make it clearly and
well. Plan the order in which you will say things, and think about what you will
write on the whiteboard, and where. There are several important reasons for
this.</p>

<p>Our communication goes better and quicker if you prepare well, and this makes
better use of our limited time. If I have to spend more time understanding you,
you get lower quality feedback and it is harder to work together towards a
solution. Don’t underestimate the importance of the quality of your presentation
to the fruitfulness of our interaction. If I find it difficult to understand
you, I pay less attention and tune out, and if it continues over time, have less
and less inclination to know what you are up to, and that is probably not to
your advantage.</p>

<p>Students often launch into the middle of their current technical problem. It is
at the forefront of your mind because you have been working on it. It is not
necessarily at the forefront of mine: I have many projects, and my memory is
flakey in my advancing old age. Please bear with me here. Start from the
beginning, checking up where I am and what I remember. Present things in logical
sequence, slowly.</p>

<p>Think of your presentations to me as practice for ones to other people and
larger audiences.</p>

<p>Preparation for presentation is different from the actual technical work. No
matter how deep you are into your problem, you have to think separately about
how to present it concisely and clearly.</p>

<p>Not all meetings call for presentation, so don’t go overboard either. You may
not be presenting anything.</p>

<h3 id="question">Question</h3>

<p>With regard to my preparation and presentation for meetings with my advisor:
(Mark all that apply)</p>

<ol>
  <li>I prepare carefully</li>
  <li>I prepare a little</li>
  <li>I just waltz in</li>
  <li>I want more feedback about how to do it and when I am doing it well or badly</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="meeting-notes">Meeting notes</h3>
<p>Some of you remember what we discuss, others don’t and I have to repeat it next
time. I suggest you bring a notebook with you to our meetings and take notes.
Don’t hesitate to spend time doing that or to ask me to stop while you do. Ask
for clarifications or repetitions if necessary. Make sure we are clear with each
other about the technical issues and what to do next. If we have to go over the
same thing again at the next meeting, time is wasted for both of us.</p>

<h3 id="meeting-wrap-ups">Meeting wrap-ups</h3>
<p>Try to be clear about where you think you are headed in the period up to the
next meeting. What are the tasks, questions, deliverables, if any? Have this
written down if you are unsure you will remember it.</p>

<h3 id="questions-1">Questions</h3>
<p>With regard to what I get out of meetings: (Mark all that apply)</p>

<ol>
  <li>I find the meetings productive and get what I want from them</li>
  <li>I get something out of them but would like to get more</li>
  <li>I leave meetings more confused than when I went in</li>
  <li>I leave meetings unsure about what I am to do next</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is how the meetings could be made more productive for me …</p>
