    <h2 id="choosing-an-area-and-an-advisor">Choosing an area and an advisor</h2>

<p>It is never too late to change areas. If you don’t like where you are now,
switching to a different area or advisor can make a marked difference. Try to
explore before settling down.</p>

<p>You should feel you have some understanding of the importance of the area you
choose, that it is worth your investment of time in it. Your advisor should be
able to inspire you about the work and give you a sense that it is worth it and
worth your time.</p>

<p>When you pick an advisor, ask yourself why you chose that person. Good reasons
include that you like that advisor’s area, that he or she can inspire you, that
you understand each other and get along. A poor reason is that you are afraid
you won’t get through and maybe this person is your best bet to make it.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="gauging-progress-am-i-on-track">Gauging progress: am I on track?</h2>

<p>The best way to know is to ask. Progress is measured in a number of ways. Direct
output, like papers is the most obvious. I also look at how your understanding
and knowledge of the materiel is developing.</p>

<h2 id="whats-phd-students-job">What’s PhD student’s job?</h2>

<p>Nothing, really. Students sometimes view a project suggested by an advisor as a
“job” they need to get done.</p>

<p>That may be appropriate for systems work; it is not in theoretical work.</p>

<p>There is really no “job” I need you to do. You are working for yourself, not for
me.</p>

<p>When I suggest projects they are only suggestions for things we can do together
or that you might do yourself.</p>

<h2 id="phd--phase-by-phase">PhD : Phase by phase</h2>

<p>Referring to the research path above, my minimal expectation at the end of Phase
1 is that you have a deep understanding of the subject of your first project.</p>

<p><strong>You should know it inside out.</strong></p>

<p>You should know what happens if something in your construction is twiddled, and
how it compares to other constructs.</p>

<p>This phase should typically take at most a year from when you begin research.</p>

<p>By the time you are in Phase 2, you should be “swimming” fairly comfortably in
the materiel.</p>

<p>You should be able to pick up new concepts rapidly and do simple proofs in your
head.</p>

<p>You should be able to make connections across different sub-areas, have some
sense of what is known and not known, and be at ease with basic techniques.</p>

<p>By the time you are in Phase 3 you should have a sense of taste, critical sense
and maturity in addition.</p>

<h2 id="research-publications-versus-thesis">Research Publications versus thesis</h2>
<p>The quantity and quality of publications you should look for varies with your
Ph.D goal.</p>

<p>If you want to head into research, whether at a research lab or in academia,
they will look at your publication record, not your thesis.</p>

<p>You want more than a minimal Ph.D.</p>

<p>You want to have had recognized publications and exposure.</p>

<p>Students headed this way shouldn’t really even be thinking about a “thesis”:
this is only a formality for the university and less than you need.</p>

<p>Try to do good research and get recognition in the research community.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-enough">What is enough?</h2>

<p>The minimal Ph.D is probably about four papers, but there is no hard and fast
rule.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may have stronger papers, or a larger contribution to co-authored
papers than in other cases, in which case fewer papers may be enough.</p>

<p>In other cases you may have more minor results or a lower contribution to
co-authered papers, in which case you may need more.</p>

<p>Remember if you want to head into research, whether at a research lab or in
academia, they will look at your publication record, not your thesis, and you
want recognized publications and exposure in the research community.</p>

<p>In addition to papers I expect you to develop communication skills, both written
and verbal. You should be able to plan and give clear talks and to write clear
and correct technical papers. There is no under-estimating the importance of
communication.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-phd-research-enough">When is PhD Research enough?</h2>

<p>Accomplishment is measured by output, not time.</p>

<p>For time, one can only talk about the typical.</p>

<p>The typical time-frame is five years, assuming the first year is spent in
coursework and you start research the second year.</p>

<p>Finishing in less time than that is neither unusual nor unusually difficult.</p>

<p>If it looks like you may take more than five years, it is not a good sign. At
that point, funding and lab space start getting denied, so beware.</p>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

<p>With regard to my rate of progress towards my Ph.D goal</p>

<ol>
  <li>I think I’m ahead of the game</li>
  <li>I think I’m about on track</li>
  <li>I’m worried I’m behind</li>
  <li>I haven’t a clue: why doesn’t someone tell me?</li>
  <li>Don’t ask now, because tomorrow I’m going to work twice as hard</li>
</ol>

<p>With regard to understanding and knowledge of the materiel</p>

<ol>
  <li>I think I’m ahead of the game</li>
  <li>I think my accomplishments and understanding are about where they should be</li>
  <li>I’m worried my accomplishments and understanding are below where they should be</li>
  <li>I haven’t a clue: why doesn’t someone tell me?</li>
  <li>Don’t ask now, because tomorrow I’m going to work twice as hard</li>
</ol>
