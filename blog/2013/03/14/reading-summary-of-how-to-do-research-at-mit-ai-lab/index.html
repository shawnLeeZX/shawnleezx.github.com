  <div class="content post-content container" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Recently, I am trying to figure out what it means to do some research in the AI field. And I came across again the very article written by the people of the great university — MIT. This time, with clearer questions and more experience, I read it again. Here is the reading notes:</p>

<h2 id="first-it-is-about-reading-in-the-ai-field">First, it is about reading in the AI field.</h2>
<!-- more -->

<p>According to the article, for me, a novice undergraduate, it is ok for now to just read textbook and published articles. If I would do research in the future, it may be more suitable to try to get in the research community and read draft passed around by those people.</p>

<h3 id="what-journals-should-i-read">What journals should I read:</h3>

<p>(TODO: since the article was published in 1988, the information may be some kind of outdated. Try search on the google to get the up-to-date information.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Principle journal for central-systems is Artificial Intelligence, also referred as “the journal of Artificial Intelligence”, or “AIJ”. Most of the really important papers in AI eventually make it into AIJ, so it’s worth scanning through back issues every year or so; but a lot of what it prints is really boring.</p>

  <p>Computational Intelligence is a new competitor that’s worth checking out. Cognitive Science also prints a fair number of significant AI papers. Machine Learning is the main source on what it says. IEEE PAMI is probably the best established vision journal; two or three interesting papers per issue. The International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) is new and so far has been interesting. Papers in Robotics Research are mostly on dynamics; sometimes it also has a landmark AIish robotics paper. IEEE Robotics and Automation has occasional good papers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="how-should-i-read-a-article">How should I read a article:</h3>
<p>See page 5 of the original article.</p>

<p>If I am interested in one specific subfield, what should I do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Try to find a senior graduate student and ask him for the ten most important articles in this field. Right now, that I can think of is to:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>ask the graduate students in the lab which I have contacts.</li>
  <li>I can find phd students by browsing the websites of top schools, like cmu, which is the only university that I have done some study. And it may be better to ask them about such stuff.
However, before all this, find yourself a subfield.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="second-it-is-about-getting-connected">Second, it is about getting connected.</h2>

<p>What could I do right now:</p>

<ol>
  <li>find electronic mailing lists that discuss AI subfields.</li>
  <li>when I read something interesting, try to recommend it to someone may be interested. For example, the video about waston I read days ago. Some good books may be of some help as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the heuristics:</p>

<p>• There’s a bunch of electronic mailing lists that discuss AI subfields like
connectionism or vision. Get yourself on the ones that seem interesting.</p>

<p>• Whenever you talk about an idea you’ve had with someone who knows the
field, they are likely not to give an evaluation of your idea, but to say, “Have
you read X?” Not a test question, but a suggestion about something to read
that will probably be relevant. If you haven’t read X, get the full reference
from your interlocutor, or better yet, ask to borrow and Xerox his copy.</p>

<p>• When you read a paper that excites you, make five copies and give them to
people you think will be interested in it. They’ll probably return the favor.</p>

<p>• The lab has a number of on-going informal paper discussion groups on vari-
ous subfields. These meet every week or two to discuss a paper that everyone
has read.</p>

<p>• Some people don’t mind if you read their desks. That is, read the papers that
they intend to read soon are heaped there and turn over pretty regularly.
You can look over them and see if there’s anything that looks interesting.
Be sure to ask before doing this; some people do mind. Try people who seem
friendly and connected.</p>

<p>• Similarly, some people don’t mind your browsing their filing cabinets. There
are people in the lab who are into scholarship and whose cabinets are quite
comprehensive. This is often a faster and more reliable way to find papers
than using the school library.</p>

<p>• Whenever you write something yourself, distribute copies of a draft of it
to people who are likely to be interested. (This has a potential problem:
plagiarism is rare in AI, but it does happen. You can put something like
“Please do not photocopy or quote” on the front page as a partial prophy-
lactic.) Most people don’t read most of the papers they’re given, so don’t
take it personally when only a few of the copies you distribute come back
with comments on them. If you go through several drafts—which for a jour-
nal article you should—few readers will read more than one of them. Your
advisor is expected to be an exception.</p>

<p>• When you finish a paper, send copies to everyone you think might be in-
terested. Don’t assume they’ll read it in the journal or proceedings sponta-
neously. Internal publication series (memos and technical reports) are even
less likely to be read.</p>

<p>• The more different people you can get connected with, the better. Try to
swap papers with people from different research groups, different AI labs,
different academic fields. Make yourself the bridge between two groups of
interesting people working on related problems who aren’t talking to each
other and suddenly reams of interesting papers will flow across your desk.</p>

<p>• When a paper cites something that looks interesting, make a note of it.
Keep a log of interesting references. Go to the library every once in a while
and look the lot of them up. You can intensively work backward through a
“reference graph” of citations when you are hot on the trail of an interesting
topic. A reference graph is a web of citations: paper A cites papers B
and C, B cites C and D, C cites D, and so on. Papers that you notice
cited frequently are always worth reading. Reference graphs have weird
properties. One is that often there are two groups of people working on the
same topic who don’t know about each other. You may find yourself close to
closure on searching a graph and suddenly find your way into another whole
section. This happens when there are different schools or approaches. It’s
very valuable to understand as many approaches as possible—often more so
than understanding one approach in greater depth.</p>

<p>• Hang out. Talk to people. Tell them what you’re up to and ask what they’re
doing. (If you’re shy about talking to other students about your ideas, say
because you feel you haven’t got any, then try talking to them about the
really good—or unbelievably foolish—stuff you’ve been reading. This leads
naturally into the topic of what one might do next.) There’s an informal
lunch group that meets in the seventh floor playroom around noon every
day. People tend to work nights in our lab, and so go for dinner in loose
groups. Invite yourself along.</p>

<p>• If you interact with outsiders much—giving demos or going to conferences—
get a business card. Make it easy to remember your name.</p>

<p>• At some point you’ll start going to scientific conferences. When you do, you
will discover fact that almost all the papers presented at any conference are
boring or silly. (There are interesting reasons for this that aren’t relevant
here.) Why go to them then? To meet people in the world outside your lab.
Outside people can spread the news about your work, invite you to give
talks, tell you about the atmosphere and personalities at a site, introduce
you to people, help you find a summer job, and so forth. How to meet
people? Walk up to someone whose paper you’ve liked, say “I really liked
your paper”, and ask a question.</p>

<p>• Get summer jobs away at other labs. This gives you a whole new pool of
people to get connected with who probably have a different way of looking
at things. One good way to get summer jobs at other labs is to ask senior
grad students how. They’re likely to have been places that you’d want to
go and can probably help you make the right connections.</p>

<h2 id="third-it-is-about-writting">Third, it is about writting.</h2>

<p>It seems that I have begun to write before I got instruction from this article. And now my direction is more clear — it feels better when your understanding accords with the extraordinary people. So try to officially get started and keep going.</p>

<h3 id="thing-to-keep-in-mind">Thing to keep in mind:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>write at the time your work developing, not at the time it is done.</li>
  <li>what you write is always drafts, so do not try to write perfectly if you are not going to officially publish it — it takes too much time.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="here-are-reasons-to-write">Here are reasons to write:</h3>

<p>• You are required to write one or two theses during your graduate student
career: a PhD and maybe an MS, depending on your department.</p>

<p>• Writing a lot more than that gives you practice.</p>

<p>• Academia runs on publish-or-perish. In most fields and schools, this starts
in earnest when you become a professor, but most graduate students in our
lab publish before they graduate. Publishing and distributing papers is good
politics and good publicity.</p>

<p>• Writing down your ideas is the best way to debug them. Usually you will
find that what seemed perfectly clear in your head is in fact an incoherent
mess on paper.</p>

<p>• If your work is to benefit anyone other than yourself, you must communicate
it. This is a basic responsibility of research. If you write well more people
will read your work!</p>

<p>• AI is too hard to do by yourself. You need constant feedback from other
people. Comments on your papers are one of the most important forms of
that.</p>

<p>Here is how to improve my writting skills:</p>

<p>• Read books about how to write. <em>Strunk and White’s Elements of Style</em>
gives the basic dos and don’ts. <em>Claire Cook’s The MLA’s Line By Line
(Houghton Mifflin)</em> is about editing at the sentence level. <em>Jacques Barzun’s
Simple and Direct: A Rhetoric for Writers (Harper and Row, 1985)</em> is about
composition.</p>

<p>• When writing a paper, read books that are well-written, thinking in back-
ground mode about the syntactic mechanics. You’ll find yourself absorbing
the author’s style.</p>

<p>• Learning to write well requires doing a lot of it, over a period of years, and
getting and taking seriously criticism of what you’ve written. There’s no
way to get dramatically better at it quickly.</p>

<p>• Writing is sometimes painful, and it can seem a distraction from doing the
“real” work. But as you get better at it, it goes faster, and if you approach
it as a craft, you can get a lot of enjoyment out of the process for its own
sake.</p>

<p>• You will certainly suffer from writer’s block at some point. Writer’s block
has many sources and no sure cure. Perfectionism can lead to writer’s block:
whatever you start to write seems not good enough. Realize that writing is
a debugging process. Write something sloppy first and go back and fix it up.
Starting sloppy gets the ideas out and gets you into the flow. If you “can’t”
write text, write an outline. Make it more and more detailed until it’s easy
to write the subsubsubsections. If you find it really hard to be sloppy, try
turning the contrast knob on your terminal all the way down so you can’t
see what you are writing. Type whatever comes into your head, even if it
seems like garbage. After you’ve got a lot of text out, turn the knob back
up and edit what you’ve written into something sensible.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-write">How to write.</h3>

<p>Another mistake is to imagine that the whole thing can be written out
in order. Usually you should start with the meat of the paper and write
the introduction last, after you know what the paper really says. Another
cause of writer’s block is unrealistic expectations about how easy writing is.
Writing is hard work and takes a long time; don’t get frustrated and give
up if you find you write only a page a day.</p>

<p>• Perfectionism can also lead to endless repolishing of a perfectly adequate
paper. This is a waste of time. (It can also be a way of semideliberately
avoiding doing research.) Think of the paper you are writing as one state-
ment in a conversation you are having with other people in the field. In a
conversation not everything goes perfectly; few expect that what they say
in a single utterance will be the whole story or last word in the interchange.</p>

<p>• Writing letters is good practice. Most technical papers would be improved
if the style was more like a letter to a friend. Keeping a diary is also a way
to practice writing (and lets you be more stylistically experimental than
technical papers). Both practices have other substantial benefits.</p>

<p>• It’s a common trap to spend more time hacking the formatter macrology
than the content. Avoid this. LaTeX is imperfect, but it has most of the
macrology you want. If that’s not enough, you can probably borrow code
from someone else who has wanted to do the same thing. Most sites (in-
cluding MIT) maintain a library of locally-written extensions.</p>

<p>• Know what you want to say. This is the hardest and most important factor
in writing clearly. If you write something clumsy and can’t seem to fix it,
probably you aren’t sure what you really want to say. Once you know what
to say, just say it.</p>

<p>• Make it easy for the reader to find out what you’ve done. Put the sexy stuff
up front, at all levels of organization from paragraph up to the whole paper.
Carefully craft the abstract. Be sure it tells what your good idea is. Be
sure you yourself know what it is! Then figure out how to say it in a few
sentences. Too many abstracts tell what the paper is generally about and
promise an idea without saying what it is.</p>

<p>• Don’t “sell” what you’ve done with big words or claims. Your readers are
good people; honesty and self-respect suffice. Contrariwise, don’t apologize
for or cut down your own work.</p>

<p>• Often you’ll write a clause or sentence or paragraph that you know is bad,
but you won’t be able to find a way to fix it. This happens because you’ve
worked yourself into a corner and no local choice can get you out. You have
to back out and rewrite the whole passage. This happens less with practice.</p>

<p>• Make sure your paper has an idea in it. If your program solves problem X in
10 ms, tell the reader why it’s so fast. Don’t just explain how your system
is built and what it does, also explain why it works and why it’s interesting.</p>

<p>• Write for people, not machines. It’s not enough that your argument be
correct, it has to be easy to follow. Don’t rely on the reader to make any
but the most obvious deductions. That you explained how the frobnitz
worked in a footnote on page seven is not a justification when the reader
gets confused by your introducing it without further explanation on page
twenty-three. Formal papers are particularly hard to write clearly. Do not
imitate math texts; their standard of elegance is to say as little as possible,
and so to make the reader’s job as hard as possible. This is not appropriate
for AI.</p>

<p>• After you have written a paper, delete the first paragraph or the first few
sentences. You’ll probably find that they were content-free generalities, and
that a much better introductory sentence can be found at the end of the
first paragraph of the beginning of the second.</p>

<h2 id="fourth-it-is-about-finding-information-of-advisors">Fourth, it is about finding information of advisors.</h2>

<p>For me right now, only the first tow points given is practical:</p>

<p>• Read the Lab’s research summary. It gives a page or so description of what
each of the faculty and many of the graduate students are up to.</p>

<p>• Read recent papers of any faculty member whose work seems at all interest-
ing.</p>

<h2 id="the-last-is-the-emotional-factors">The last, is the emotional factors:</h2>

<p>I want to begin with one sentence in the article:</p>

<p>It’s easy to interpret your project failing as your failing; in fact, it proves that you had the courage to do something difficult.
In my word, knows your limitation, and, keep trying and exercise in moderation.</p>

<p>Another thing that is hard to realise is that you alone cannot revolutionize the AI field, just try to find one subfield and forward a little bit of its state-of-art.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-prevent-yourself-from-being-stuck">How to prevent yourself from being stuck.</h3>

<p>• Setting your sights too high leads to paralysis. Work on a subproblem to
get back into the flow.</p>

<p>• You can get into a positive feedback loop in which doubts about your ability
to do the work eat away at your enthusiasm so that in fact you can’t get
anything done. Realize that research ability is a learned skill, not innate
genius.</p>

<p>• If you find yourself seriously stuck, with nothing at all happening for a week
or more, promise to work one hour a day. After a few days of that, you’ll
probably find yourself back in the flow.</p>

<p>• It’s hard to get started working in the morning, easy to keep going once
you’ve started. Leave something easy or fun unfinished in the evening that
you can start with in the morning. Start the morning with real work—if you
start by reading your mail, you may never get to something more productive.</p>

<p>• Fear of failure can make work hard. If you find yourself inexplicably “unable”
to get work done, ask whether you are avoiding putting your ideas to the
test. The prospect of discovering that your last several months of work have
been for naught may be what’s stopping you. There’s no way to avoid this;
just realize that failure and wasted work are part of the process.</p>

<p>• Read Alan Lakien’s book How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life,
which is recommended even by people who hate self-help books. It has
invaluable techniques for getting yourself into productive action.</p>

<p>TODO: great books, How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life</p>

<h3 id="there-is-more-value-in-you-than-you-think">There is more value in you than you think:</h3>

<p>It’s easy not to see the progress you have made. “If I can do it, it’s trivial. My
ideas are all obvious.” They may be obvious to you in retrospect, but probably
they are not obvious to anyone else. Explaining your work to lots of strangers will
help you keep in mind just how hard it is to understand what now seems trivial
to you. Write it up.</p>

<h3 id="be-more-realistic-and-focus-on-one-subfield">Be more realistic and focus on one subfield.</h3>

<p>It’s easy to think that I’m the one who is going to solve this AI problem for once and for all.
There’s nothing wrong with this; it takes vision to make any progress in a field
this tangled. The potential pitfall is discovering that the problems are all harder
than you expected, that research takes longer than you expected, and that you
can’t do it all by yourself. This leads some of us into a severe crisis of confidence.
You have to face the fact that all you can do is contribute your bit to a corner of a
subfield, that your thesis is not going to solve the big problems. That may require
radical self-reevaluation; often painful, and sometimes requiring a year or so to
complete. Doing that is very worthwhile, though; taking yourself less seriously
allows you to approach research in a spirit of play.</p>

<h3 id="ways-to-know-about-lives-of-scientists">Ways to know about lives of scientists:</h3>

<p>In getting a feeling for what research is like, and as inspiration and consolation
in times of doubt, it’s useful to read some of the livelier scientific autobiographies.
Good ones are Gregory Bateson’s Advice to a Young Scientist, Freeman Dyson’s
Disturbing the Universe, Richard Feynmann’s Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feyn-
mann!, George Hardy’s A Mathematician’s Apology, and Jim Watson’s The Double
Helix.</p>
