<p>Computer, is a medium to create. The inner most thing that drives me to stick in what I am choosing, learning in computer science, and what’s more, trying to do some research in artificial intelligence — to acquire the capability to create something fascinating, or even revolutional. That’s what drives me. It has never be that clear till this moment. I am not going to be a boring pure mathematician — that’s why I did not choose math as my major. I am not going to become merely a coder, that’s why I am trying to learn things in ai and mathematics. Maybe my dream is to create something, or someone, that could talk with me like some people, though I recently realised it is not realistic to achieve such accomplishment, by reading the article, how to do research at MIT AI lab, combined with the understanding I have made so for in the ai area.</p>

<p>I aim at being artists. There is one quotes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you put out your hands, you are a laborer. If you put out your mind, you are a craftman. If you put out your hand, mind and soul, you are an artists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another point is about freedom, I am not going to do research for papers, for funding. I want to become I want to. I want freedom, though it is hard, extremely hard. This may related to the “day job” talked in the book — you need a day job to make a living and at night, you do whatever you want. Maybe the luckiest thing in the universe is to take your day job as your hobby.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the answer to this problem, in the case of software, is a
concept known to nearly all makers: the day job. This phrase
began with musicians, who perform at night. More generally, it
means you have one kind of work you do for money, and another
for love.</p>

  <p>Nearly all makers have day jobs early in their careers. Painters
and writers notoriously do. If you’re lucky you can get a day job
closely related to your real work. Musicians often seem to work in
record stores. A hacker working on some programming language
or operating system might likewise be able to get a day job using
it.</p>

  <p>– Paul Granham</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Research is a road, a medium for me to train myself to be a artist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, beautiful things don’t always make the best subjects
for papers. Number one, research must be original—and as
anyone who has written a PhD dissertation knows, the way to
be sure you’re exploring virgin territory is to to stake out a piece
of ground that no one wants. Number two, research must be
substantial—and awkward systems yield meatier papers, because
you can write about the obstacles you have to overcome in order
to get things done. Nothing yields meaty problems like starting
with the wrong assumptions. Most of AI is an example of this
rule; if you assume that knowledge can be represented as a list of
predicate logic expressions whose arguments represent abstract
concepts, you’ll have a lot of papers to write about how to make
this work. As Ricky Ricardo used to say, “Lucy, you got a lot of
explaining to do.”</p>

  <p>The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle
tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing
ideas in a slightly new way. This kind of work is hard to convey
in a research paper.</p>

  <p>– Paul Granham</p>
