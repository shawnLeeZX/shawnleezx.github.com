    <p>Currently, this blog is mainly about tecnique notes and academic notes
    taken for the purpose of clarifying thoughts and a secondary storage of my
    memory. Due to time budget, most of the academic notes are not very
    clear. Technical notes are fine. Hope that as I become more experienced,
    and have more free time, contents that are more valuable for readers would
    be posted. It also has a few historical notes and repost about life, though
    I started to write things somewhere else long time ago.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="excerpt-content">
          <p>Finally, I have come up with a solution to convert Djvu format e-book to Pdf
format. This post is going to note down exactly HOW.</p>

<p>First, some background about why I am doing this.</p>

<p>In the ancient time, well-know scholars are proud of their collection of books
in their personal library, which is the physical incarnation of their knowledge
and journey of learning. Although still a majority of people prefers the old
way of reading paper books, the way to keep one’s collection of books is going
to change to the electronic format way eventually. There are three significant
benefits of doing this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You are able to bring with you all your books anywhere without any extra
effort.</li>
  <li>E-books are searchable, which speed up your reading a lot.</li>
  <li>You can open multiple copies of your book at the same time so the cross
reference is much more easier than reading paper version.</li>
</ol>

<p>But one major drawback of the past years where I almost read e-books
exclusively is that at the time when I can only find djvu format of certain
files, I have no way to highlight text on the e-book, especially for Math
books, a lot of which are in djvu format.</p>

<p>After meeting with one file that I must take note, I decide to figure out a
solution. So here it is.</p>

          <p>This post is about explaining intuitions behind the definition of
continuity, in calculus context and topological context, with a focus
on why it is not defined in the other way around. A number of counter
examples are provided.</p>

<p>Note that between calculus context and topological context, there is
still one intermediate step which is metric space context. But it is
basically not different too much in the calculus context so I omit it.</p>

          <h2 id="wavelet-in-image">Wavelet in Image</h2>

<p>The next question is how could we mathematically model the process?
How could we mathematically define “semantic”?</p>

<p>In an explicit sense, “semantic” is taught. We see an axe as axe is
because all people speaking English call it axe. It would be 斧头 in
Chinese. Semantic expressed is nothing but common agreement. Semantic
not expressed is what the object looks like, what the it could do and
so on so forth. This is the highest level of knowledge. Decomposing it
further, an axe may made up of one head and one body. The body may
just be a stick while the head may be just a special shape iron. So
one semantic is composed of more sub semantics. Down to this level,
all are still learned. How could we keep analyzing?</p>

<p>We may start with things that are simple and remember the ultimate
task is to extract semantic information from raw image.</p>

<p>Again, we return back audio signal, or one dimensional signal –
neither of them are perfectly accurate. We consider problem in
seismology. Different type of rock layers reflect to the detecting
signal in different frequency pattern in the short range of time the
signal encountering the layer. So to find rock layers that contain
oil, the task is to find patterns in the reflected signals. Such
patter represents semantic meaning that “I am the oil layer you are
looking for.” Such semantic is learned. Maybe different encountering
directions will create different signals, but they all should convey
the same semantic. In this case, semantic is gradually lowed down to
physical properties,meaning there are some deformation in the
signal. The different direction here is analogue with seeing one
object in different faces. In our vision, we do not learn different
faces of object, but by recognizing similarity in their physical
shape. To sum up, the task is to find some small patterns in a bunch
of noisy signals reflected back by the rock layer, and such signals
should be of some invariant properties. If we could find the invariant
right, based on such invariance, we can learn patterns that we can give
meaning to them.</p>

<p>Now, let’s return back to the image problem. Images are made up of
pixels. Pixels makes surfaces and edges. Surfaces and edges make
objects. So the first step is how to identify surfaces and edges in
the image. This bridges the gap between audio signal and digital
image! High frequency patters in audio signal is very representative
like the discovering oil example above. Analogue of high frequency
signal in image is edges, which represents rapid change in the gray
level of image. Consequently, low frequency signal is analogue with
surface. To identify surfaces and edges, we identify high and low
frequency components of the image. This is what wavelet does.</p>

<p>I will do more experiments to see what this leads.</p>

<p>Now we have analyzed what information we could utilize and what are
their physical meaning of digital image. Let us return back to the
vision problem. How could we imitate human vision? This is the
ultimate purpose of computer vision. OK, maybe not ultimate, since we
could surpass human being but we are way far from there.</p>

<p>The first step to solve a problem, which is imitating human vision in
this case is to ask the right preliminary question. What question
should we ask? Since we are trying to imitate human vision, what
specific features or functions what we are trying imitate? I guess the
question is, a lot. But among them, the most fundamental one should be
how do human distinguishes different objects, which is the basis how
human accumulates knowledge of the world. In computer vision’s
terminology, how does human do objects recognition?</p>

<p>The whole process may be simplified as human are extracting semantic
information from the image forming on human’s retina. Though such
process seems simple for humans, it is a rather complex procedure that
takes thousands of talents on the problem for tens of years without
really understanding it. Now we have a high level description of the
task – extracting semantic information from raw digital image. So
how could we define “semantic”?</p>

<p>When we say an axe, it is actually made up of infinite amount of
sources that reflects light. In the digital image, it consists of a
region of different gray scale. So when we see the points that make
the axe, our vision system extract the axe from the background and
tells us there is an object called axe there. Such process is called
extracting semantic information from raw image.</p>

<p>This should be our vision system is constantly processing as long as
we are opening our eyes.</p>

          <p>One dimension convolution(I am not sure I have understand two
dimension yet) may be a very natural idea when you are from Electrical
Engineering(EE) background – I found out this recently by reading
books about signals and system, especially for the one written by
Oppenheim(thought as I was talking with PhD from EE background, some
of them does not understand convolution.). But as a computer science
major background with no prior exposure to EE, it does not seem to be
that natural.</p>

<p>This post aims to introduce convolution from scratch.</p>

<p>Convolution roots from signal processing, mainly in Linear Time
Invariant(LTI) System. Convolution will be introduced in this
setting. Then the intuition will be explained, both in its physical
interpretation and computation procedure. Just note here that, as its
widely usage on various forms of application, it is generalized by
mathematicians, who make it a mathematical operation like correlation,
which loses its original physical Interpretation(this is where the
most confusion comes around the first time I encounter such a
concept).</p>

<p>My journey of teaching myself mathematics begins with learning the
number theory, understanding why matrix is invented. Thus up to now,
most of the effort was spent on matrix algebra and matrix calculus.</p>

<p>Recently, I am trying to understand wavelet theory. The main
motivation behind it is to find a set of basis to approximate
functions, which seems to involve a lot of analysis. Therefore, I
beginning to teach myself analysis like a math major student from
scratch.</p>

<p>This post is about another concept called <strong>compact</strong>. You can find
previous post about real number system <a href="/blog/2014/09/30/why-and-how-we-construct-real-number-system/">here</a>.</p>
