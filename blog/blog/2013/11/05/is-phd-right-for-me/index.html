<h1 id="is-phd-right-for-me">Is PhD Right for me?</h1>

<p>You should try to come to a frank appraisal of whether a Ph.D is the right thing
for you. You need to be totally honest with yourself about this. You need to
consider the question at several levels:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is going for a Ph.D the right thing for me?</li>
  <li>If so, is the area I am pursuing now right for me?</li>
  <li>If so, is the advisor I have now right for me?</li>
</ol>

<p>My goal here is to make you think about these things. Here are some things to
think about and pitfalls to avoid in answering these questions.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Don’t be scared or turned off by what is below; I am only playing devil’s
advocate to get you to think!</p>

<h2 id="dont-kid-yourself">Don’t kid yourself</h2>

<p>Liking research it is liking DOING it, not liking thinking about where it puts
you, or liking to view yourself as someone who does it.</p>

<p>Separate the process from any perceived goal.</p>

<p><strong>You will only be happy in research if you enjoy the process, the day-to-day nuts
and bolts of it.</strong></p>

<p>If to you it is only a means to some end, you are unlikely to enjoy yourself.</p>

<h2 id="story-of-my-friend">Story of My Friend</h2>

<p>I had a friend once who from childhood had a dream of being a mathematician. She
loved the idea of being a person of the intellect. That way of life appealed to
her. However, at the time she had this dream, she had no idea what mathematics
really involved.</p>

<p>She followed mathematics and theoretical computer science in college and grad
school. However, she had a really hard time setting herself to the task.</p>

<p>Working on math problems was tiresome for her. It was very hard to have the
discipline to sit down and do this boring thing.</p>

<p>She was not at all dumb; far from it, being extremely intelligent.</p>

<p>The problem was that although she wanted to be a mathematician, she actually
hated doing the stuff. But you can’t be it without doing it.</p>

<p>What is exhibited here is the gap between a picture of how you want to see
yourself and what is involved in actually being that.</p>

<p><strong>Be wary of falling in love with a high-level goal when you find the nuts and
bolts tiresome.</strong></p>

<p>When you sit down daily to do your work in the lab, working on your research
problem, writing the paper, are you bored?</p>

<p>Is it hard to motivate yourself to be there?</p>

<p>Is it really not fun?</p>

<p>Are you saying, “I have to do this?”</p>

<p>Those are bad signs. It is not fun everyday, and all of it is not fun, but those
of us that are in this business enjoy a large fraction of the process.</p>

<p>For me, for example, thinking about a research problem is not work. It is
probably about the most fun thing I can think of doing.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be that fond of it, but if to you it is just work, to be done
and gotten rid off as soon as possible, you are in the wrong business.</p>

<p>You might with a great deal of discipline finish your Ph.D, but experience has
shown that even then you will not have a real sense of accomplishment or
happiness. You will also make my life difficult. (Professor’s Life)</p>

<p>Again, liking research it is liking DOING it, not liking thinking about where it
puts you. Be wary of childhood dreams; they are often formed without any idea of
what is actually involved in the process of attaining them.</p>

<h2 id="am-i-smart-enough-to-do-phd">Am I smart enough to do PhD?</h2>

<p>That’s the wrong question. There is no such thing as “smart enough”.</p>

<p>If you love playing the piano, play it. You don’t expect to be Alfred Brendel or
Vladimir Ashkenazy. But you are doing something productive for yourself and
those around you.</p>

<p>Research is the same. If you enjoy doing it, pursue it.</p>

<p><strong>You will usually find that you can contribute something.</strong></p>

<p>As you go on, you will discover your strengths and find you have something
unique to offer.</p>

<p>Maybe there are others who are smarter in some way; they can compute complex
probabilities in their head faster than you can, or whatever. But your
contributions may be valuable in other ways.</p>

<p>As discussed above, research has many components.</p>

<p>Problem solving, identifying issues, presentation, modeling, and criticism are
amongst them.</p>

<p><strong>See what aspects best suit your abilities and personality. There is probably a
niche for you somewhere.</strong></p>

<p>What is written above about kidding yourself does NOT refer to ability or
perception of ability; it refers to motivation and honesty about motivation.</p>

<p>I (professor) want to be sure you are pursuing research for the “right” reasons.</p>

<h2 id="self-confidence">Self-confidence</h2>

<p>Self-confidence affects our performance and success in all walks of life, from
sports to socializing to dating.</p>

<p>It plays a role in research too.</p>

<p>Sometimes I meet students who don’t have confidence. This can lead to a disinclination to work.</p>

<p><strong>Fear of failure leads to inactivity.</strong></p>

<p>People  ”freeze up” because they are so worried they aren’t “good enough”.</p>

<p>If this sounds familiar, at least you know you are not alone.</p>

<p>Increasing your self-confidence is very much a personal issue, but here are some reflections from my experience.</p>

<p>You can find confidence only within yourself. Don’t expect to get it from others, even your advisor. Someone telling you that you did well is useful to boost morale, but in the end you must believe in yourself.</p>

<p>If you are afraid of failure you will have a hard time succeeding.</p>

<h2 id="bicycle-vs-research">Bicycle vs Research</h2>

<p>You have to fall a few times to learn to skate or ride a bicycle.</p>

<p>Research is worse.</p>

<p>Once you learn to ride a bicycle you don’t fall again, but in research you never
stop failing.</p>

<p>You will fail far more often than you succeed. But it is from your failures that
you learn. They increase your understanding and maturity.</p>

<p>If you find the process of research fun, failure to solve a problem is not
daunting. In fact, it leads to all kinds of discoveries. So you need to learn to
not care about failing, but use it to get new ideas.</p>

<p>One nice thing about research is that nobody need know when you failed.</p>

<p>You write papers only about your successes. But that is also deceptive, because
you don’t see the failures of others. But they are there. Even the top people
don’t always succeed. Gauss failed sometimes, as did Einstein.</p>

<p>Try to ask yourself exactly why you lack confidence. Be entirely honest with
yourself. Go back to the discusions above about your motivations.</p>

<h3 id="question">Question</h3>

<p>How much self-confidence do I have with regard to research? (Mark all that apply)</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’m the hottest thing ever</li>
  <li>Enough to pursue a problem for a while and be reasonably sure, if I abandon
it, that it is not solvable</li>
  <li>Enough to pursue a problem for a while and be reasonably sure, if I abandon
it, that it would be pretty hard, even for experts</li>
  <li>I give up pretty quick</li>
  <li>I can’t even start thinking for fear of not solving it</li>
</ol>
