<h2 id="dual-monitor-on-gnome">Dual Monitor on Gnome</h2>

<p>I uses <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> as my desktop environment ever since the
time I started using Linux. So naturally, the desktop I tried this time to
manage multi-monitor support is Gnome. By default, the dual monitor worked
pretty OK. The only one thing that may need a tweak is: by default, Gnome(my
version is 3.9.90), only supports workspace in primary monitor, so when you
switch back and forth between different workspace, the secondary monitor stays
fixed on whatever it is on. This kind of makes the extra monitor many times
less useful. To make the secondary monitor attach to current workspace, so it
moves when you switch workspaces, you need to configure Gnome a little bit, by
the following command</p>

<p><code>bash
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.overrides workspaces-only-on-primary false
</code></p>

<p>One drawback of making such a change is <code>guake</code> will stay on the secondary
window forever. Did not get the time to look into the source code to know why
:(.</p>

<p><em>Updated on Jan 9, 2016.</em></p>

<strike>It is weird. `guake` functions normally now, after a reboot. This is probably
not the first time I reboot. I guess it is the package updates that fixed
something.</strike>

<p>I figured out why. When you maximize <code>guake</code> it sticks with that monitor, but
your cancel maximization, it would reconsider it position by probing which
monitor the mouse is in and set itself there.</p>

<h2 id="physical-layout-of-monitors">Physical Layout of Monitors</h2>

<p>I do not know how much it depends on operating system, drivers and
hardware. The <code>display</code>(the GUI one of Gnome) or <code>nvidia-settings</code>(the CLI one
comes with proprietary driver) forgets the monitor layout after reboot, such as
<code>DVI-I-1</code> should be on the left of <code>DVI-D-0</code>, even if I wrote it in the
<code>xorg.conf</code>.</p>

<p>Though finally I switched the monitors physically, for some other reason, and
made peace with the forgetful display manager, I struggled some time to figure
out how to make the layout right.</p>

<p>The solution I used is to use <code>xrandr</code> after the GUI session has set up by
adding a script containing the following line in the startup application of
Gnome(there is a GUI program called <code>Startup Application</code>, though I do not know
what its CLI version is).</p>

<p><code>
xrandr --output DVI-I-1 --mode 1920x1080 --right-of DVI-D-0
</code></p>

<p>I also have tried to add the above line in <code>.profile</code>, but it seems the layout
setting is decided after <code>.profile</code> is loaded, so it did not work.</p>

<p><em>Updated on Mar 8, 2016.</em></p>

<p>I seems to figured out how gnome handle layout of monitors. The one that powered
on the first will be the primary monitor, and be put on the left. The one added
later will be put at the right. So if you want to change the layout of monitors,
just disconnect the one you want to put at the right, then connect again.</p>

<h2 id="a-peak-at-kde">A Peak at KDE</h2>

<p>At the first time I tried to set <code>workspaces-only-on-primary</code> to <code>false</code>, it
did not have any effect, and first all workspaces other than the first one
started to get severe artifact when moving windows around, then even the first
one started to get artifacts. It made the desktop unusable.</p>

<p>After trying to search for an solution in Google for a while, I learned there
seems Gnome do not have any multi-monitor support at all, at least they do not
consider this a feature to be proud of at their website for Gnome 3. So I think
maybe Gnome does not work for Gnome.</p>

<p>Then some video introducing Plasma let me pay some attention to KDE
desktop. The modern design of KDE Plasma 5.5 really impressed me, though in
retrospect I was dazzled by Gnome 3’s new design at the first I saw it. It is
just the case that I have been used to Gnome 3 for such a long time and do not
feel its design at all now.</p>

<p>I installed Plasma from source by</p>

<p><code>bash
sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
</code></p>

<p>This is the first time I started to feel Ubuntu 14.04 is getting old. It only
has Plasma 4.14(the minor version may not be right, but it is 4).</p>

<p>After tinkering it a little bit, though it must be the case I did not get
myself familiar with it, I have the first impression as following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It seems to have many widgets, which is better than Gnome, whose desktop
widget feels like antiques.</li>
</ol>

<p>Besides that, I did not find an obvious solution to</p>

<ol>
  <li>multiple workspaces, which is available by default in Gnome</li>
  <li>the dash application runner(I am not sure its exact name, just you press the
<code>super</code> or <code>win</code> key in you desktop and it shows up). I tried to install
a app called <code>homerun</code>, but it just adds too much icons in the desktop and
creates too much clutters.</li>
  <li>Obvious, <code>guake</code> does not work here anymore.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above three are really killer app, and cannot not be lacking.</p>

<p>So the first impression is KDE is for the GUI users.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It has a good file manager called <code>Dolphin</code>, whose functionality is better
than <code>Nautilus</code>. But I almost do not use GUI file management since I do it
all in CLI.</li>
  <li>A similar application launcher of dash of Gnome is <code>Krunner</code>. But like
Unity, it not only search for applications, but also search for files, any
opened applications etc, which creates much clutter, though this is a
desktop user wants.</li>
  <li>Again, no easy drop-down terminal like <code>guake</code>.</li>
  <li>It adds too much clutter that may not be useful, compared with a clean wall
paper of Gnome. I think Plasma 5.5 tries to fix this, but I did not have the
chance to try.</li>
</ol>

<p>As having been said, it must be the case I am not familiar with a new desktop
environment, but I guess I will settle with it, because after I was little
frustrated with the KDE desktop, I tried to switch back to Gnome. Suddenly,
everything started to work well! Maybe it is because I installed a lot of
libraries when I was installing KDE, which fixed some problems. But now I feel
current setting, the one I mentioned at the first section of this note,
awesome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just tried to find a solution to zoom in and out in the GNOME desktop, so that
things could be seen better in case they are too small during presentation.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The solution a program called <code>mousewheelzoom</code>, whose source is held at github:
<a href="https://github.com/tobiasquinn/gnome-shell-mousewheel-zoom">gnome-shell-mousewheel-zoom</a>.</p>

<p>The installation instructions could be found there.</p>

<hr />

<p>Besides the solution that works, two solutions that did not work are also going
to noted below.</p>

<h3 id="compiz-setting">Compiz Setting</h3>

<p>At first I tried to changing setting in Compizconfig Settingsmanager, as
suggested in the
<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/82398/how-to-zoom-inzoom-out">link</a>. It turns
out that compiz is used by Unity, not GNOME. Since I have changed the desktop
environment, it does not obviously.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-native-solution">GNOME Native solution</h3>

<p>Then GNOME also offers such function directly in their <em>Universal Access</em>,
under <em>Seeing</em> tab, in category Zoom — just type Universal Access in the
Dock. However, it does not work either.</p>
