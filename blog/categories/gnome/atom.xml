    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just tried to find a solution to zoom in and out in the GNOME desktop, so that
things could be seen better in case they are too small during presentation.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The solution a program called <code>mousewheelzoom</code>, whose source is held at github:
<a href="https://github.com/tobiasquinn/gnome-shell-mousewheel-zoom">gnome-shell-mousewheel-zoom</a>.</p>

<p>The installation instructions could be found there.</p>

<hr />

<p>Besides the solution that works, two solutions that did not work are also going
to noted below.</p>

<h3 id="compiz-setting">Compiz Setting</h3>

<p>At first I tried to changing setting in Compizconfig Settingsmanager, as
suggested in the
<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/82398/how-to-zoom-inzoom-out">link</a>. It turns
out that compiz is used by Unity, not GNOME. Since I have changed the desktop
environment, it does not obviously.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-native-solution">GNOME Native solution</h3>

<p>Then GNOME also offers such function directly in their <em>Universal Access</em>,
under <em>Seeing</em> tab, in category Zoom â€” just type Universal Access in the
Dock. However, it does not work either.</p>
