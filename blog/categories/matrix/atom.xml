<p>It is a bit hard to internalize the fact that the composition of finite
dimensional linear transformation is the multiplication of the matrices
representing them. I figured out a concept explanation.</p>

<p>Denoting the first transformation matrix as $A$ and the second as $B$,
$\vec{a_{i}}$ as the row of $A$ and $\vec{b_{j}}$ as the row of $B$, the to
be transformed vector as $x$, basically, each $\vec{a}_{i}$ determines how
each coordinate $x_{i}$ of $\vec{x}$ will contribute to the result
coordinates.</p>

<p>Then if you do another linear transform on $\vec{Ax}$, each $\vec{b}_{j}$ determines how
each coordinate of $\vec{Ax}$ will contribute to the final vector. Since the transform is
linear, we could first consider how $\vec{a_{i}}$ contributes to the final
vector, its final result with $x$ is just a multiple of $x_{i}$. Each
component of $\vec{a_{i}}$ actually could be taken as a to be transformed
vector of $B$. Each row of $AB$ could be viewed in the following way.</p>

<p>$\vec{a_{i}}$ is the new coordinate of standard basis $\vec{e_{i}}$ after
applying $A$. Starting from there, the second new coordinates of those first
new coordinates are obtained by applying $B$. So if we apply $AB$ on standard
basis $\vec{e_{i}}$, the result is going to be the second new
coordinates. Actually, such coordinates are:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\sum\vec{b_{j}}(\vec{a_{i}})_{j}
</script>

<p>which is just $\vec{(AB)_{i}}$.</p>
