<a href="http://history.nasa.gov/reagan12886.html">transcript</a> from NASA website.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>

<p>We’ve grown used to wonders in this century. It’s hard to dazzle us. But for 25
years the United States space program has been doing just that. We’ve grown
used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we’ve only just
begun. We’re still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were
pioneers.</p>

<p>I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this
happen. It’s all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It’s all
part of taking a chance and expanding man’s horizons. <strong>The future doesn’t belong
to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave</strong>. The Challenger crew was pulling
us into the future, and we’ll continue to follow them.</p>

<p>There’s a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir
Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. <strong>In his lifetime the
great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, “He lived by the
sea, died on it, and was buried in it.”</strong> Well, today we can say of the
Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake’s, complete.</p>

<p>The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they
lived their lives. <strong>We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them,
this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and “slipped
the surly bonds of earth” to “touch the face of God.”</strong></p>

<h2 id="full-speech">Full Speech</h2>

<!-- more -->

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I’d planned to speak to you tonight to report on the
state of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those
plans. Today is a day for mourning and remembering.</p>

<p>Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We
know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a
national loss.</p>

<p>Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible
accident on the ground. But we’ve never lost an astronaut in flight; we’ve
never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we’ve forgotten the courage it took
for the crew of the shuttle; but they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the
dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven
heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison
Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation
together.</p>

<p>For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of
this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we’re thinking about you so very
much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace,
that special spirit that says, “Give me a challenge and I’ll meet it with joy.”
They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished
to serve, and they did. They served all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve grown used to wonders in this century. It’s hard to dazzle us. But for 25
years the United States space program has been doing just that. We’ve grown
used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we’ve only just
begun. We’re still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were
pioneers.</p>

<p>And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching
the live coverage of the shuttle’s takeoff. I know it is hard to understand,
but sometimes painful things like this happen. It’s all part of the process of
exploration and discovery. It’s all part of taking a chance and expanding man’s
horizons. The future doesn’t belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the
brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we’ll continue
to follow them.</p>

<p>I’ve always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what
happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don’t hide our space program. We
don’t keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in
public. That’s the way freedom is, and we wouldn’t change it for a minute.</p>

<p>We’ll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more
shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in
space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.</p>

<p>I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for
NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: “Your dedication and
professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your
anguish. We share it.”</p>

<p>There’s a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir
Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the
great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, “He lived by the
sea, died on it, and was buried in it.” Well, today we can say of the
Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake’s, complete.</p>

<p>The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they
lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them,
this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and “slipped
the surly bonds of earth” to “touch the face of God.”</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Thought Provoking Story</p>

<p>This Too Shall Pass – Understand This Deeply</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Once A King Called Upon All Of His Wise Men And Asked Them, ” Is There A Mantra
Or Suggestion Which Works In Every Situation, In Every Circumstances, In Every
Place And In Every Time. In Every Joy, Every Sorrow, Every Defeat And Every
Victory? One Answer For All Questions? Something Which Can Help Me When None Of
You Is Available To Advise Me? Tell Me Is There Any Mantra?”</p>

<p>All The Wise Men Were Puzzled By The King’s Question. They Thought And
Thought. After A Lengthy Discussion, An Old Man Suggested Something Which
Appealed To All Of Them. They Went To The King And Gave Him Something Written
On Paper, With A Condition That The King Was Not To See It Out Of Curiosity.</p>

<p>Only In Extreme Danger, When The King Finds Himself Alone And There Seems To Be
No Way, Only Then He Can See It. The King Put The Papers Under His Diamond
Ring.</p>

<p>Some Time Later, The Neighbors Attacked The Kingdom. King And His Army Fought
Bravely But Lost The Battle. The King Had To Flee On His Horse. The Enemies
Were Following Him. Getting Closer And Closer. Suddenly The King Found Himself
Standing At The End Of The Road - That Road Was Not Going Anywhere. Underneath
There Was A Rocky Valley Thousand Feet Deep. If He Jumped Into It, He Would Be
Finished…And He Could Not Return Because It Was A Small Road…The Sound Of
Enemy’s Horses Was Approaching Fast. The King Became Restless. There Seemed To
Be No Way.</p>

<p>Then Suddenly He Saw The Diamond In His Ring Shining In The Sun, And He
Remembered The Message Hidden In The Ring. He Opened The Diamond And Read The
Message. The Message Was – “ THIS TOO SHALL PASS ”</p>

<p>The King Read It . Again Read It. Suddenly Something Struck Him- Yes ! This Too
Will Pass. Only A Few Days Ago, I Was Enjoying My Kingdom. I Was The Mightiest
Of All The Kings. Yet Today, The Kingdom And All My Pleasures Have Gone. I Am
Here Trying To Escape From Enemies. Like Those Days Of Luxuries Have Gone, This
Day Of Danger Too Will Pass. A Calm Came On His Face. He Kept Standing
There. The Place Where He Was Standing Was Full Of Natural Beauty. He Had Never
Known That Such A Beautiful Place Was Also A Part Of His Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Revelation Of The Message Had A Great Effect On Him. He Relaxed And Forgot
About Those Following Him. After A Few Minutes He Realized That The Noise Of
The Horses And The Enemy Coming Was Receding. They Moved Into Some Other Part
Of The Mountains And Were Nowhere Near Him.</p>

<p>The King Was Very Brave. He Reorganized His Army And Fought Again. He Defeated
The Enemy And Regained His Empire. When He Returned To His Empire After
Victory, He Was Received With Much Fanfare. The Whole Capital Was Rejoicing In
The Victory.</p>

<p>Everyone Was In A Festive Mood. Flowers Were Being Showered On King From Every
House, From Every Corner. People Were Dancing And Singing. For A Moment King
Said To Himself, “ I Am One Of The Bravest And Greatest King. It Is Not Easy To
Defeat Me. With All The Reception And Celebration He Saw An Ego Emerging In
Him. ”</p>

<p>Suddenly The Diamond Of His Ring Flashed In The Sunlight And Reminded Him Of
The Message. He Open It And Read It Again: “ THIS TOO SHALL PASS ”.</p>

<p>He Became Silent. His Face Went Through A Total Change - From The Egoist He
Moved To A State Of Utter Humbleness. If This Too Is Going To Pass, It Is Not
Yours. The Defeat Was Not Yours, The Victory Is Not Yours. You Are Just A
Watcher. Everything Passes By. We Are Witnesses Of All This. We Are The
Perceivers. Life Comes And Goes. Happiness Comes And Goes. Sorrow Comes And
Goes.</p>

<p>Now As You Have Read This Story, Just Sit Silently And Evaluate Your Own
Life. This Too Will Pass. Think Of The Moments Of Joy And Victory In Your
Life. Think Of The Moment Of Sorrow And Defeat. Are They Permanent ? They All
Come And Pass Away.</p>

<p>Life Just Passes Away. There Is Nothing Permanent In This World. Every Thing
Changes Except The Law Of Change. Think Over It From Your Own Perspective. You
Have Seen All The Changes. You Have Survived All Setbacks, All Defeats And All
Sorrows. All Have Passed Away. The Problems In The Present, They Too Will Pass
Away. Because Nothing Remains Forever. Joy And Sorrow Are The Two Faces Of The
Same Coin. They Both Will Pass Away.</p>

<p>You Are Just A Witness Of Change. Experience It, Understand It, And Enjoy The
Present Moment - This Too Shall Pass</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>爱因斯坦1921年获诺奖时的演讲，其对死亡、理想、意义、社会关系、阶级、宗教、自由、民主、个人和群体、对科学的追求均与我现在的观点共鸣。</p>

<p>未找到原文原稿。</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>我们这些人总有一死的。人的命运是多么奇特呀！我们每个人在这个世界上都只作一个短暂
的逗留；目的何在，却无所知，尽管有时自以为对此若有所感。但是，不必深思，只要从日
常生活就可以明白：人是为别人而生存的——首先是为那样一些人，他们的喜悦和健康关系着
我们自己的全部幸福；然后是为许多我们所不认识的人，他们的命运通过同情的纽带同我们
密切结合在一起。</p>

<p>我每天上百次地提醒自己：我的精神生活和物质生活都依靠别人（包括活着的人和死去的人）
的劳动，我必须尽力以同样的分量来报偿我所领受了的和至今还在领受的东西。我强烈地向
往着简朴的生活，我认为阶级的区分是不合理的，它最后所凭借的是以暴力为根据。我也相
信，简单淳朴的生活，无论在身体上还是在精神上，对每个人都是有益的。</p>

<p>我完全不相信人类会有那种在哲学意义上的自由。每一个人的行为，不仅受着外界的强迫，
而且还要适应内心的必然。叔本华（Schopenhauer）说，“人能够做他想做的，但不能要他
所想要的。”这句话从我青年时代起，就对我是一个非常真实的启示；在自己和别人生活面
临困难的时候，它总是使我得到安慰，并且永远是宽容的源泉。这种体会可以宽大为怀地减
轻那种容易使人气馁的责任感，也可以防止我们过于严肃地对待自己和别人；它还导致一种
特别给幽默以应有地位的人生观。</p>

<p>要追究一个人自己或一切生物生存的意义或目的，从客观的观点看来，我总觉得是愚蠢可笑
的。可是每个人都有一定的理想，这种理想决定着他的努力和判断的方向。就在这个意义上，
我从来不把安逸和快乐看作是生活目的本身——这种伦理基础，我叫他猪栏的理想。照亮我的
道路，并且不断地给我新的勇气去愉快地正视生活的理想，是善、美和真。要是没有志同道
合者之间的亲切感情，要不是全神贯注于客观世界——那个在科学与艺术工作领域永远达不到
的对象，那么在我看来，生活就会是空虚的。人们所努力追求的庸俗的目标——财产、虚荣、
奢侈的生活——我总觉得都是可鄙的。</p>

<p>我对社会正义和社会责任的强烈感觉，同我显然的对别人和社会直接接触的冷漠，两者总是
形成古怪的对照。我实在是一个“孤独的旅客”，我未曾全心全意地属于我的国家、我的家庭、
我的朋友，甚至我最接近的亲人；在所有这些关系面前，我总是感觉到有一定距离并且需要
保持孤独——而这种感受正与年俱增。人们会清楚地发觉，同别人的相互了解和协调一致是有
限度的，但这不足惋惜。这样的人无疑有点失去他的天真无邪和无忧无虑的心境；但另一方
面，他却能够在很大程度上不为别人的意见、习惯和判断所左右，并且能够不受诱惑要去把
他的内心平衡建立在这样一些不可靠的基础之上。</p>

<p>我的政治理想是民主主义。让每一个人都作为个人而受到尊重，而不让任何人成为崇拜的偶
像。我自己受到了人们过分的赞扬和尊敬，这不是由于我自己的过错，也不是由于我自己的
功劳，而实在是一种命运的嘲弄。其原因大概在于人们有一种愿望，想理解我以自己的微薄
绵力通过不断的斗争所获得的少数几个观念，而这种愿望有很多人却未能实现。我完全明白，
一个组织要实现它的目的，就必须有一个人去思考，去指挥，并且全面担负起责任来。但是
被领导的人不应该受到强迫，他们必须有可能来选择自己的领袖。</p>

<p>在我看来，强迫的专制制度很快就会腐化堕落。因为暴力所招引来的总是一些品德低劣的人，
而且我相信，天才的暴君总是由无赖来继承，这是一条千古不易的规律。就是这个缘故，我
总是强烈地反对今天我们在意大利和俄国所见到的那种制度。象欧洲今天所存在的情况，使
得民主形式受到了怀疑，这不能归咎于民主原则本身，而是由于政府的不稳定和选举中与个
人无关的特征。我相信美国在这方面已经找到了正确的道路。他们选出一个任期足够长的总
统，他有充分的权力来真正履行他的职责。另一方面在德国的政治制度中，我所重视的是，
它为救济患病或贫困的人作出了比较广泛的规定。在人类生活的壮丽行列中，我觉得真正可
贵的，不是政治上的国家，而是有创造性的、有感情的个人，是人格；只有个人才能创造出
高尚的和卓越的东西，而群众本身在思想上总是迟钝的，在感觉上也是迟钝的。</p>

<p>讲到这里，我想起了群众生活中最坏的一种表现，那就是使我所厌恶的军事制度。一个人能
够洋洋得意地随着军乐队在四列纵队里行进，单凭这一点就足以使我对他轻视。他所以长了
一个大脑，只是出于误会；单单一根脊髓就可以满足他的全部需要了。文明国家的这种罪恶
渊薮应当尽快加以消灭。由命令而产生的勇敢行为，毫无意义的暴行，以及在爱国主义名义
下一切可恶的胡闹，所有这些都使我深恶痛绝！在我看来，战争是多么卑鄙、下流！我宁愿
被千刀万刮，也不愿参与这种可憎的勾当。尽管如此，我对人类的评价还是十分高的，我相
信，要是人民的健康感情没有被那些通过学校和报纸而起作用的商业利益和政治利益加以有
计划的破坏，那么战争这个妖魔早就该绝迹了。</p>

<p>我们所能有的最美好的经验是神秘的经验。它是坚守在真正艺术和真正科学发源地上的基本
感情。谁要是体验不到它，谁要是不再有好奇心也不再有惊讶的感觉，他就无异于行尸走肉，
他的眼睛是迷糊不清的。就是这种神秘的经验——虽然掺杂着恐怖——产生了宗教。 我们认识
到某种为我们所不能洞察的东西存在，感觉到那种只能以其最原始的形式为我们所感受到的
最深奥的理性和最灿烂的美——正是这种认识和这种情感构成了真正的宗教感情；在这个意义
上，而且也只是在这个意义上，我才是一个具有深挚宗教感情的人。</p>

<p>我无法想象一个会对自己的创造物加以赏罚的上帝，也无法想象它会有象在我们自己身上所
体验到的那样一种意志。我不能也不愿去想象一个人在肉体死亡以后还会继续活着；让那些
脆弱的灵魂，由于恐惧或者由于可笑的唯我论，去拿这种思想当宝贝吧！我自己只求满足于
生命永恒的奥秘，满足于觉察现存世界的神奇结构，窥见它的一鳞半爪，并且以诚挚的努力
去领悟在自然界中显示出来的那个理性的一部分，即使只是其极小的一部分，我也就心满意
足了。</p>

    <updated>2014-08-31T21:06:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2014/08/31/excerpt-from-the-will-power-instinct</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This excerpt is the final chapter of the book,
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Willpower-Instinct-Self-Control-Matters/dp/1583335080/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409490772&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+will+power+instinct">The Will Power Instinct</a></em>,
which summarizes the points in the book.</p>

<p>To try to make the summary more compact, I may summary it into the
following points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The book utilizes the discoveries from neuroscience, which gives a
simple explanation of the mechanism how human brain works. With
such understanding, it tries to understand self control and makes it
work.</li>
  <li>The key point to self control is you have something to pursue,
fight for or want to protect, which is described as <em>I want</em> power
in the book.</li>
</ol>

<!-- more -->

<p>We started our journey together in the savannah of the Serengeti,
being chased by a saber-toothed tiger. Now we find ourselves here, on
the last few pages, ending our tour. Along the way, we’ve seen chimps
display extraordinary self-control, and quite a few humans lose
control. We’ve visited laboratories where dieters must resist
chocolate cake, and anxiety sufferers must face their fears. We’ve
watched as neuroscientists discovered the promise of reward, and
neuromarketers discovered its payoff. We’ve come across interventions
that use pride, forgiveness, exercise, meditation, peer pressure,
money, sleep, and even God to motivate people to change their
ways. We’ve met psychologists who shock rats, torture smokers, and
tempt four-year-olds with marshmallows —all in the name of the science
of willpower.</p>

<p>I hope this tour has provided more than a voyeur’s glimpse into the
fascinating world of research. Each of these studies teaches us
something about ourselves and our own willpower challenges. They help
us recognize our natural capacity for self-control, even if we
sometimes struggle to use it. They help us understand our failures and
point at possible solutions. They even tell us something about what it
means to be human. For example, we’ve seen again and again that we are
not one self, but multiple selves. Our human nature includes both the
self that wants immediate gratification, and the self with a higher
purpose. We are born to be tempted, and born to resist. It is just as
human to feel stressed, scared, and out of control as it is to find
the strength to be calmand in charge of our choices. Self-control is a
matter of understanding these different parts of ourselves, not
fundamentally changing who we are. In the quest for self-control, the
usual weapons we wield against ourselves—guilt, stress, and
shame—don’t work. People who have the greatest self-control aren’t
waging self-war. They have learned to accept and integrate these
competing selves.</p>

<p>If there is a secret for greater self-control, the science points to
one thing: the power of paying attention. It’s training the mind to
recognize when you’re making a choice, rather than running on
autopilot. It’s noticing how you give yourself permission to
procrastinate, or how you use good behavior to justify
self-indulgence. It’s realizing that the promise of reward doesn’t
always deliver, and that your future self is not a superhero or a
stranger. It’s seeing what in your world—from sales gimmicks to social
proof—is shaping your behavior. It’s staying put and sensing a craving
when you’d rather distract yourself or give in. It’s remembering what
you really want, and knowing what really makes you feel
better. Self-awareness is the one “self ” you can always count on to
help you do what is difficult, and what matters most. And that is the
best definition of willpower I can think of.</p>
