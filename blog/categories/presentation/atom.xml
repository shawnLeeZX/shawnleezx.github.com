    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some notes on teaching and learning.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The way we teach reflects the way we learn and the way we communicate. Teaching
gives me another perspective on how may I could be taught or just, learn from
others. Such experience has led me a long way to realize my deficiency.</p>

<p>I attended a workshop on teaching today and want to note down something
learned. It is the first time I got systematical training on how to teaching,
which is equivalent to how to learn.</p>

<p>The following stuffs come from the handout in the workshop.</p>

<h3 id="seven-research-based-principles-for-smart-teaching">Seven Research-based Principles for Smart Teaching</h3>

<p>There are seven principles in teaching, which also means in learning.</p>

<ol>
  <li>prior knowledge</li>
  <li>structuring knowledge</li>
  <li>motivation</li>
  <li>self-awareness on the one’s situation</li>
  <li>synthesis of different parts of acquired knowledge </li>
  <li>feedback</li>
  <li>emotional feeling, social and intellectual climate</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a systematical summary of elements that involves in the learning
process. Prior knowledge is what you already have; structuring knowledge is how
you condense your knowledge and build inner connection between different
separate parts; motivation is power house behind all your efforts;
self-awareness is about a clear awareness of one’s current situation — what
one have known, what one do not know, what one know one do not know; synthesis
is where something new could happen; feedback is how people get to know their
mistakes, so they could fix them, and learn new things; emotional stability and
social support is very important for long term learning.</p>

<p>After some thinking, it seems that nothing is really new for me, but the
summary is helpful.</p>

<h3 id="on-motivation">On Motivation</h3>

<p>Another important part on teaching and learning discussed is what motivate
people to do better on tasks that need cognitive thinking.</p>

<p>I long have known only money is not enough. Today I got a very good summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The factors that motivate to do great work is autonomy, mastery and
purpose. There should many materials online talking on this given this is a
research output from scientists.</p>

<h3 id="three-skills-on-communication">Three Skills On Communication</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Storytelling</li>
  <li>Contextualizing</li>
  <li>Sketching</li>
</ol>

<p>All those are kind of one thing. People learn from examples, so we need
storytelling; people learn from examples that they know the most, so we need
contextualize the examples with their experience; people learn bit by bit,
dynamically, so we need to present it bit by bit, like sketching a picture.</p>

<p>It is easier said that done. Practice is important.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just got some illuminating advice about doing presentation. They come from the
teaching team of ME310 course of Stanford University. Share it here.</p>

<p>Will provide more after as I learn more.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Virtually all photos are ambiguous on first sight by persons not previously
 involved with your project.  THEREFORE, all photos are made more informative
 when annotated with accents, labels, call-outs, whatever.  This also applies to sketches and CAD images.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid complex (multi-part) images.  Focus on one-message per slide.  This often translates to one
graphic, table, diagram, or photo per slide.  If it is worth showing, it is worth making it
intelligible with a minimum of time and attention by the audience. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SHOW ME, don’t tell me.  Use images rather than words.  Follow the ancient dictum to show, not tell.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Walk the audience through the flow of the diagram, image, visualization if the image is a relatively 
complex (more than 3 elements).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prioritize, what are the 1-3 most important things you want the audience to remember. 
Craft your narrative  around these KEY points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simplify/Clarify, make each slide as clear, unambiguous and memorable as possible.
Delete uninformative graphics, backgrounds, and logos.  Make everything READABLE
from anywhere in the audience given the presentation technology (that you have tested).</p>
  </li>
</ol>
