  <li>Selective pressure is the key to evolution of civilization.</li>
  <li>Technology and economics are root cause of politics and relationship between
people. Political system is devised to deal with current technological and
economical status of society. If it is designed against them, its
development will be stagnant.</li>
  <li>The truly new thing rises from ash of past glory – great advance comes from
a fresh start.</li>
  <li>Culture and traditional is wisdom of ancestor to ensure their survival and
prosperity in their society. In this fast changing society, we must change
to master change.</li>
  <li>Humans are raised to be evil or good, not born to.</li>

  <li>
    <p>Each age writes its own history. Not because the earlier history is
wrong, but because each age faces new problems, ask new questions,
and seeks new answers. This precept is self-evident today when the
tempo of change is increasing exponentially, creating a
correspondingly urgent need for new history posing new questions
and offering new answers. – Page xxv</p>

    <p>“For the first time in the course of history,” concludes physicist
Werner Heisenberg, “man on earth faces only himself; he finds no
longer any other partner or foe.” The great irony of our era is
that this primacy is a root cause of our current global malaise and
apprehension. Having eliminated all possible rivals, we humans on
longer confront any foes. We confront only ourselves.<br />
This new confrontation with our inner self rather than with the
outside world is a formidable undertaking. It requires not merely
the acquisition of more knowledge and technology, an enterprise in
which we have proven unequaled. It requires also the crowning of
that knowledge with an ethical compass to provide it with direction
and purpose. In the seventeenth century, when the scientific
revolution was emerging, the English philosopher Francis Bacon
noted its potentiality and warned against its perils. He
enthusiastically endorsed the pursuit of “knowledge and skill”
through science, but he added that the pursuit should be conducted
with “humility and charity,” and not “for the please of mind, or
for contention, or for superiority to others, or for profit or
fame, or power, or any of these inferior things; but for the
benefit and use of life.”<br />

virtues of the individual.<br />

    <p>Anthropology holds up a great mirror to man and lets him look at
himself in his infinite variety. – Clyde Kluckhohn, Page 3</p>

    <p>In short, our problem as a species is to balance our ever-expanding
knowledge with wisdom in how we use that knowledge. We shall see in
the following chapters that learning how to balance knowledge and
wisdom is becoming so urgent that , as Einstein has warned us, our
future as a species depends on the outcome. – Page 6</p>

    <p>The important lesson that history teaches us is that such wars are
not inevitable. They have occurred not because of human nature but
because of human societies. And human societies have been made by
human beings and can be remade by human beings. This is the gist of
the following conclusion by anthropologist Ashley Montagu
concerning human nature: “Certainly we born with genetically based
capacities for many kinds of behavior, but the manner in which
these capacities become abilities depends upon the training they
receive, upon learning … Our true inheritance lies in our ability
  to make and shape ourselves, not the creatures but the creators of
destiny.” – Page 39</p>

    <p>I have seen the metal-worker at his task at the mouth of his
furnace, with fingers like a crocodile’s. He stank worse than
fish-spawn…. The stonemason finds his work in every kind of hard
stone. When he has finished his labors his arms are worn out, and
he sleeps all doubled up until sunrise, His knees and spine are
broken…. The barber shaves from morning till night; he never sits
down except to meals. He hurries from house to house looking for
business. He wears out his arms to fill his stomach, like bees
eating their own honey…. The farmer wars the same clothes for all
times. His voice is as raucous as a crow’s. His fingers are always
busy, his arms are dried up by the wind. He takes his rest – when
he does get any rest – in the mud. If he’s in good health he
shares good health with the beasts if he is ill his bed is the bare
earth in the middle if his beasts….<br />
Apply your heart to learning. In truth there is nothing that can
compare with it. I f you have profited by a single day at school
it is a gain for eternity. – Page 49</p>

    <p>Although the origins of writing are to be found in the new
circumstances arising from the production of economic surplus, it
has other far-reaching and fateful effects. It stimulated
intellectual development because factual data could now be
collected, recorded, and passed along to successive
generations. Equally significant, writing helped to define and
consolidate individual cultures. It gave permanent written form to
religious traditions, which thereby became sacred books; to social
customs, which became law codes; and to oral myths and stories,
which became classics. Thus writing became the chief means for the
cultural integration of the civilizations of mankind. – Page 53</p>

    <p>At the core f Buddhism are four great truths: (1) Life is sorrow;
(2) the cause of sorrow is desire; (3) escape is possible only by
stopping desire; and (4) the cessation of desire can only be
achieved by the “eight-fold” path which is comprised of right
belief, right ambition, right speech, right conduct, right living ,
right effort , right thoughts, and right pleasures. The objective
of all this effort is Nirvana, literally meaning “emptiness,” the
“blowing out of the flame.” – Page 84</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the
institutions of others. We do not copy our neighbors, but are an
example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for
the administration is in the hands of the many and not the
few. But while the law secures equal justice to all alike in their
private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognized, and
when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the
public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of
merit. Neither is poverty a bar, but a man may benefits his
country whatever be the obscurity of his condition. There is no
exclusiveness in our public life, and in our private intercourse
we are not suspicious of one another, nor angry with our neighbor
if he does what he likes…. We are lovers of the beautiful, yet
simple in our tastes, and we cultivate the mind without loss of
manliness. Wealth we employ, not for talk and ostentation, but
when there is a real use for it. To avow poverty with us is no
disgrace; the true disgrace is in doing nothing to avoid it. n
Athenian citizen does not neglect the state because he takes care
of his own household; and even those of us who are engaged in
business have a very fair idea of politics. We alone regard a man
who takes no interest in public affairs, not as a harmless, but as
a useless character; and if few of us are originator, we are all
sound judges of policy. The great impediment to action is , in our
opinion, not discussion, but the want of that knowledge which is
gained by discussion preparatory to action. For we have a peculiar
power of thinking before we at and of acting too….<br />
To sum up: I say that Athens is the school of Hellas….<br />
I have paid the required tribute, in obedience to the law, making
use of such fitting words as I had. The tribute of deeds has been
paid in part; for the dead have been honorably interred, and it
remains only that their children should be maintained at the
public charge until they are grown up: this is the solid prize
with which, as with garland, Athens crowns her sons living and
dead, after a struggle like theirs. – Pericles’s funeral oration

    <p>The most successful of the new religious was Christianity. It
offered the doctrine of one God, the Father Omnipotent, in place
of the polytheism of the Greco-Roman gods and the monotheism of
the oriental cult. It brought the solace of a Redeemer, Jesus, who
was not an ambiguous figure in a mythological labyrinth but who
miraculously lived an earthly life, even though he was the Son of
God. “I bring you tidings of great joy which shall be to all
people.” Christianity also guaranteed salvation to the believer,
but instead of a starry eternity, it restored him to life through
a personal resurrection foreshadowed by the Resurrection of Christ
himself. Perhaps most important of all, Christianity provided
fellowship when times were disjointed and common people felt
uprooted and forsaken. All Christians were brothers, and their
meetings were often called agape, meaning “love” in Greek. They
assisted one another, and by their devotion and self-denial they
set an aspiring and contagious example. Thus at a time when the
laws and philosophy of the old order were becoming irrelevant and
inviable, Christianity offered relevance and hope for the meek and
the humble. – Page 112-113</p>

    <p>Today we have that knowledge, and therefore we have the potential
to free ourselves from millennia-old scourges. It is tragic that
the potential has not yet been realized, but the fact remains that
it does exist. And it exists because of the advances made possible
in the past by the different civilizations of the human
race. Therefore, to answer the question, has civilization been a
curse or a blessing? – in the past it has been both. What it will
be in the future depends on whether the knowledge accumulated from
past civilizations is used for destructive or constructive
purposes. – Page 161</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The millennium between the sixth century, when the Sui dynasty
restored imperial unity, and the sixteenth, when the Westerners
began their intrusion by sea, was for China an era of unparalleled
political, social, and cultural stability. But this stability
paradoxically proved to be a curse as well as a blessing. It was a
blessing because Chinese society during this millennium provided
more material advantages and more psychological security for more
people than any other society in the world. But the stability was
also a curse because China was so successful and comfortable that
it remained relatively unchanged, though not completely static. At
the same time, however, as we shall see in the following chapter,
the West was being transformed by its technological achievements,
its economic vitality, and its social and political pluralism. All
this engendered a dynamism that culminated in the West’s
domination of the entire globe. The end result, then, was the
disruption of the beautifully balanced but conservative Chinese
society by the irresistible expansionism of the West. – Page 211</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The renaissance of Confucian thought took place mostly during the
time of troubles following the collapse of the T’ang dynasty, when
the needs of the age clearly called for something more than the
mere memorization of Confucian classics. Accordingly, a number of
scholars undertook a searching reappraisal of the problems of
humankind and of the universe.<br />
A leader in this undertaking was Chu Hsi(1129-1200), who in his
youth had studies both Buddhism and Taoism. Satisfied with
neither, he turned to the Confucian classics, and with his
remarkable talent for synthesis he worked out an interpretation
that combined elements of Buddhism and Taoism with Confucianism
and that was more satisfying and relevant for his time. His
approach – essentially that of the empirical rationalist –
taught that the universe is governed by natural law, which should
be understood and respected. He also believed in the goodness of
people and in their ability to become more perfect. He compared
the individual to a mirror covered with dust, which if cleaned
will be as bright as ever. Evil, therefore, was the result of
neglect and of defective education, and hence could be corrected.<br />
Chu Hsi’s influence in the Confucian world was comparable to that
of Thomas Aquinas in Western Christendom. – Page 219 - 220</p>
  </li>

    <p>“We should note the force, effort, and consequences of inventions
which are nowhere more conspicuous than in those three which were
unknown to the ancients, namely, printing, gunpowder, and the
compass. For these three have changed the appearance and state of
the whole world.” This statement by the British
philosopher-scientist Francis Bacon (1561-1626) is especially
significant because all three of the inventions that he so wisely
selected originated from China. Yet they had little effect on that
country in comparison with their explosive repercussions in the
West. Chinese civilization was too deeply rooted and Chinese
imperial organization too all-embracing to allow such inventions
to disrupt traditional institutions and practices. Thus printing
was used to disseminate old ideas rather than new; gunpowder
reinforced the position of the emperor  rather than of emerging
national monarchs; and the compass, despite the remarkable
expeditions of Cheng Ho, was not used for  world trade and
exploration and empire building as in the West.<br />
The root of this fateful difference is to be found in the unique
characteristics of the new Western civilization – pluralistic,
adaptable, and free of the shackles of tradition that bound all
the other Eurasian civilizations. The new civilization brought
about historic change not only for the West but also, as Bacon
foresaw, for the entire globe as it came under the influence of
the revolutionary new society. – Page 228</p>

  <li>
    <p>The history of mankind proves that advances of culture depend upon
the opportunities presented to a social group to learn from the
experience of their neighbors. The discoveries of the group spread
to others and, the more varied the contacts, the greater the
opportunities to learn. The tribes of simplest culture are on the
whole those that have been isolated for very long periods and
hence could not profit from the cultural achievements of their
neighbors.<br />
In other words, the key to different levels of human development
has been accessibility. Those with the most opportunity to
interact with other people have been the most likely to forge
ahead. Indeed, they were driven to do so, for there was selective
pressure as well as opportunity. Accessibility involved the
constant threat of assimilation or elimination if opportunity was
not grasped. By contrast, those who were isolated received neither
stimulus nor threat, were free from selective pressure and thus
could remain relatively unchanged through the millennia without
jeopardizing their existence.<br />
If this hypothesis is applied on a global scale, the remote Australian
aborigines should have been the most culturally retarded of all major
groups; next, the American Indians in the New World; then the Negroes of
sub-Saharan Africa; and finally – the least retarded, or the most
advanced – the various peoples of Eurasia, who were in constant and
generally increasing contact with each other. This, of course, is precisely
the gradation of culture levels found by the European discoverers
after 1500. The Australian aborigines were still at the Paleolithic
food-gathering stage; the American Indians varied from the Paleolithic
tribes of California to the impressive civilizations of Mexico, Central
America, and Peru; the African Negroes presented comparable diversity,
though their overall level of development was higher; and finally, at quite
another level, there were the highly advanced and sophisticated
civilizations found Eurasia – the Moslem in the Middle East, the Hindu in
south Asia, and the Confucian in east Asia.

    <p>At its height, the Ottoman Empire was indeed a great imperial
structure. Its heartland was Turkish Asia Minor, but the majority of the
population consisted of Moslem Arabs to the south and Balkan Christians to
the west. The empire sprawled over three continents and comprised some 50
million people, compared to the 5 million of contemporary English. Little
wonder that Christians of the time looked on the ever-expanding Ottoman
Empire with awe and described it as “a daily increasing flame, catching
hold of whatsoever comes next, still to proceed further.”<br />

    <p>General knowledge is, from these causes, little if at all cultivated; every
man is supposed to know his own business or profession, with which it is
esteemed foolish and improper for any other person to interfere. The man of
general science, a character so frequent and so useful in Christian Europe,
is unknown; and nay one, but a mere artificer, who should concern himself
with the founding of cannon, the building of ships, or the like, would be
esteemed little better than a madman. The natural consequence of these
narrow views is, that the professors of any art of science are themselves
profoundly ignorant, and that the greatest absurdities are mixed with all
their speculations.<br />

    <p>Economists define modernization as the process by which humans
have increased their control over their physical environment as a
means to increasing per capita output. Sociologists and
anthropologists point out other features of modernization,
including the awakening and activation of the masses, more
interest in the present, and the future than in the past, a
tendency to view human affairs as understandable rather than as
manipulated by super natural forces, and, until recent years, a
faith in the beneficence of science and technology.<br />
From the viewpoint of world history the significance of this
modernization process is that it led inexorably to European
domination of the globe. The reason is that modernization
provided the Europeans not only with superior economic and
military power but also with superior sociopolitical cohesion and
dynamism. – Page 306</p>

    <p>These cities were dominated by the great merchant families who controlled
politics s well as trade and crafts. These families were the patrons of
Renaissance artists and writers. Their needs, interests, and tastes colored
the Renaissance cultural revival even though the patrons also included
ducal families such as Sforza of Milan, as well as popes such as Nicholas
V, Pius II, Julius II, and Leo X. This explains the secularism and humanism
of Renaissance – its concern with this world rather than the hereafter and
its focus on pagan classics rather than Christian theology.<br />
At the center of most Renaissance and literature was the person – the
new Renaissance person who was the molder of his or her own destiny rather
than the plaything of supernatural forces. People did not need to be
preoccupied with supernatural forces; rather, the purpose of life was to
develop ones’ innate potentialities. — Page 306 - 307</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The secularism and individualism of the Renaissance were reflected in its
scholarship and education. The so-called father of Renaissance litera,
Francesco Petraca, or Petrarch(1304 - 1374), stressed the value of the
classics as a means for self-improvement and a guide to social action. —

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, what is the significance of the Renaissance in the
perspective of world history? It is apparent that new emphasis on persons
and on what they could accomplish obviously was more conducive to overseas
expansion than the preceding medieval outlook. On the other hand, this
point can easily be exaggerated and needs serious modification. The fact is
that Renaissance Europe was not science-oriented. The leading figures
tended to be more aesthetic and philosophical than objective and
skeptical. They retained in various degrees certain medieval patterns of
thought. They persisted in admiring and believing the incredible and the
fantastic. They continued to seek the philosopher’s stone that would
convert other metals into gold. They still believed in astrology and
confused it with astronomy. – Page 309</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Europe’s economy was changed not only by the growing use of money but also
by the minting of standardized coins that were acceptable everywhere and by
the development of banks and of credit instruments. Florence led the way in
1252 with gold forin, and other cities and states soon followed. Simple
bills of exchange also apprears in Italy as early as the twelfth
century. Gradually, mighty banking families appeared, first in Italy and
later in northern Europe.<br />
What was happening to Europe, then, was a historic shift to a fundamentally
different type of economic system, the type know today as
capitalism. Capitalism has been defined as “… [a] system in which the
desire for profits is the driving motive and in which large accumulations of
capital are employed to make profits by various elaborate and often indirect
methods.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally significant for students of history is the fact that many laypersons
still cherish the vision of assorted Europeans, Asians, or Africans landing
on the shores of the pre-Columbian New World, bearing aloft the torch of
civilization. The fact is that humans today, as in earliest Paleolithic
times, are mesmerized by the cult of the mysterious. They cling to romantic
and simplistic explanations, even when they do not square with known
facts. Our food-gathering ancestors depended on their totems and shamans or
medicine men. Modern humans have similar faith in UFOs, numerology, tarot
cards, intelligent plants, and astrology. Readers of this text will
appreciate the significance of the following report by George Abell ,
professor of astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles:<br />
    I have polled the general university students taking my survey astronomy
    courses and find that about a thrid have an interest and belief in
    astrology. From discussion with my colleagues in other parts of the
    country I gather that about the same ratio holds everywhere and that it
    probably well represents the fraction of Americans who believe in
    astrology. It is estimated that there are more than 5,000 astrologers
    making a living in the subject in the United States. More than 1,200
    daily newspapers carry astrology columns.<br />
Professor Abell’s report was made in 1975. Polls since that date indicate
that faith in astrology is steadily increasing. Between 1980 and 1985 the
proportion of American teenagers who believe in astrology has grown from 40
to 55 percent. This resurgence of astrology today is especially noteworthy
in view of the fact that it largely disappeared when modern astronomy began
in the sixteen century.<br />
Similarly a 1996 <em>Newsweek</em> poll disclosed that 58 percent of Americans
believe UFOs (Unidentified Foreign Objects) are real, and 29 percent think
we’ve made contact with aliens, while another 48 percent believe there is a
government plot to cover it all up. More specifically, some stargazers claims
to have seen Elvis eating fried chicken on Uranus. Nor are Americans unique
in this respect. In France , nearly 50,000 taxpayers in 1995 declared
income from their work as stargazers, header, mediums, and similar
occupations. By contrast, France has 36,000 Roman Catholic priests and
6,000 psychiatrists.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my way to Peking I had to cross the whole of Siberia, Manchuria, and North
China,. No one an fail to be impressed by the journey through Siberia,
especially the first time. The dimensions of Russia are staggering. You
travel a day, you travel a week, you travel ten days, and you are still in
Russia. Except for the Ural Mountains and a stretch near Lake Baikal, the
country is absolutely flat.<br />
After you leave European Russia the population become very scarce, you pass
hours and hours without seeing any village or habitation. Near the stations
there are a few houses. Usually, when the express train arrives at the
station, the entire local population comes to stare at the
travelers. Especially in the evenings, when the train is brilliantly
illuminated by electricity and the elegant figures of some inhabitants of
Shanghai of other Far Eastern ports are visible inside, the travelers must
appear to the local residents like men from another planet. What envy and
dissatisfaction the exotic creatures in furs must provoke in the hearts of
those doomed to spent their entire life in some miserable station!<br />
I imagine a young girl who has nor yet lost the capacity to dream waiting on
the station platform. She hears the express approaching the sees it all
illuminated. The train stops for five minutes. The passengers,looking like
people from a fairy land., jump on the platform; they laugh and joke. There
i a whistle, the train with its passengers disappears, and darkness,
emptiness, and dullness reign again.<br />
It is unjust that some should move from place to place in luxury, while
others must remain in some forsaken place in misery. Small wonder that this
should cause irritation and discontent. I am convinced that the Siberian
express played an important part in the awakening of the population of
Siberia and thereby hasten the coming of the revolution. The sight of
unlimited space and the absence of life- begins to affect you, the passengers
prefer to pass their time in the diner, drinking endless glasses of tea and
playing cards….</p>

    <p>Although the Chinese, the Indians, and the Turks were unimpressed by
European culture during this period, the European, by contract, were very
much impressed by what they saw in Constantinople , in Delhi, and in
Peking. They became familiar first with the Ottoman Empire, and their
reaction was one of respect, admiration, and apprehension. As late as 1634,
after decline of the empire had set in, a thoughtful English traveler
concluded that the Turks were “the only modern people great in action” and
that “he who would behold these times in their greatest glory, could not
find a better scene than Turkey” During the seventeenth century the Ottoman
Empire lost prestige among Europeans. But at the same time European
intellectuals were becoming fascinated with numerous far-off Cathay. They
were entranced as they learned of China’s history, art, philosophy and
government. China came to be held up as a model civilization because of its
Confucian system of morals; its examination system for government service;
its respect for learning rather than for military prowess; and its exquisite
handicraft, including porcelain, silk, and lacquer work. Voltaire(1694 -
1778), for example, adorned the wail of his library with a portrait of
Confucius, and the German philosopher Leibniz(1646 - 1716) extolled the
Chinese emperor K’ang-hsi as “the monarchy .. who almost god-like mortal,
ruling all by a nod of his head, who, however, is educated to virtue and
wisdom … thereby earning the right to rule.”  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The century and a half between 1763 and 1914 stands out in the course of
world history as the period of European domination over a large part of the
globe. In 1763 Europe was still far from being the master of the world. It
had only coastal footholds in Africa and in Asia. But by 1914 the European
power had annexed the whole of Africa, and they had effectively established
their control over Asia: either directly, as in India and Southeast Asia,
or indirectly, as in the Chinese and Ottoman empires. The unprecedented
expansion of Europe was made possible by the continuation and acceleration
of the modernization process. This process was set in motion earlier by the
Renaissance, Reformation, technological development, capitalist
enterprise, state building and overseas expansion. These triggered a chain
reaction in the form of the three great revolutions – scientific,
industrial, and political – which gave Europe irresistible dynamism and
power.<br />
Two features of these revolutions might be noted at this point. One is that
they were well under way before 1763. The English Civil War, a major phase
of the political revolution, occurred in the 1640s, The scientific
revolution took place primarily during the century and a half between the
publication of Copernicus’ <em>Derevolutionibus orbium coelestium</em>(1543) and
of Newton’s <em>Principia</em>(1687). Likewise, the roots of the industrial
revolution were planed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when
the countries of northwestern Europe ‘‘were seething with such genuinely
capitalistic phenomena as systematic mechanical invention, company
formation, and speculation in the shares of financial and trading
concerns.’’ But the worldwide, impact of none of these revolutions was fully
felt until the nineteenth century. That is why we are considering them here
rather than earlier in this text.<br />
The other point to note about the three great revolutions is that they did
not run in parallel or independent lines. Scientific, industrial and
technological events were inderdependent and reacted continuously upon each
other. Nuewton’s discover of the laws governing the movements of heavenly
bodies and Darwin’s theories of biological evolutoin boath had profound
effects on political ideas. Likewise, we cold not conceive of modern
nationalism withough technological innvoations such as printing and the
telegraph. Conversely, politics affeced science, as in the case of the
French Revolutoin, which provided a powerful stimulus to scientific
advancemnt. Politics also affected economics, as was made claer by the
English manufacturer John Wilkinson, who stated bluntly, ``manufacture and
commerce will awlwasy fourish most where Church and King interfere least’’</p>
  </li>

    <p>Everyone agrees that this increase in the size of the economic cake has been
a great advantage. But there is much dispute over the question of how the
cake has been sliced. Colonial peoples feel that in the past they have had
less than their due share. The total amount that they have received obviously
has increased; otherwise their rising populations could not have been
supported. For example, a British economist has shown that in 1949 European
companies engaged in mining in mineral-rich northern Rhodesia(Zimbabwe) sold
their output for a total of f36.7 million. Of this, they spent only f12.5
million in northern Rhodesia, which meant that two-thirds of the money was
transferred abroad. Moreover, of the f12.5 million spent in northern
Rhodesia, f4.1 million was paid to European living and working there. Only
f2 million out of the f36.7 million went to the Africans working in the
mines. And yet these workers were receiving an average of f41 a year
compared to an average income of f27 a year per adult African male in the
colony.<br />
Under these circumstances it is understandable that colonial peoples are not
very impressed by increased productivity or by the wages paid by foreign
companies. They are more impressed by the wretched level at which they
subsist, especially in comparison with Western levels. They also resent
being cast in the role of hewers of wood and drawers of water, even in
regions where there are human and material resources for industrial
development. – Page 426</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Europe’s domination of the world in the nineteenth century was based not only
on its industrial and scientific revolutions but also on its political
revolution. The essence of the political revolution was the end of the
concept of a divinely ordained division of people into rulers and
ruled. Government was no longer regarded as something above the people and
the people as something below the government. Instead, the political
revolution for the first time history, at least on a scale larger than the
city-state, called for the identification of government with people. The
masses were awakened and activized so that they not only participated in
government but also considered it their inherent right to do so. – Page 428</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much influenced by the law of gravitation that Newton had demonstrated, the
philosopher believed in the existence of natural laws that regulated, on only
the physical universe, but also human society. Acting on this assumption,
they proceeded to apply reason to all fields in order to discover the natural
laws that operated in each. They subjected everything – all persons, all
institutions, all traditions – to the test of reason. What would be a
rigorous ordeal for any society in any period was particularly unsettling
for France’s ancient regime, past its prime and creaking in many joints. Thus
the philosopher subjected the old regime in France, and throughout Europe,
to a barrage of devastating criticism. More important, they evolved a set of
revolutionary principles by which  they proposed to effect a wholesale
reorganization of society. Of particular interest to us are their specific
proposals in three area – economics, religion , and government.<br />
Their key slogan in economics was laissez-fiare – let the people do what
they will, let nature takes its course. The opposition of government
intervention was a reaction to the rigid regulation of economic life
generally known as mercantilism. In the early period of state building,
mercantilism had been accepted as necessary for national security. But by
the eighteenth century it seems superfluous and damaging. The classic
account laissez-fiare was made by the Scotsman Adam Smith in his famous
work <em>An inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Walth of
Nations</em>(1776). He argued that individuals are motivated by self-interest as
far as their economic activities are concerned, that the national welfare is
simply the sum of the individual interests operating in a nation, and that
each man knows his own interest better than does any statesman.<br />
In religion the key slogan was Ecrasez l’infame – “crush the infamous
thing,” or stamp out religious fanaticism and intolerance. The philosophers
rejected the traditional belief that God controls the universe and
arbitrarily determines the fate of humanity. Instead, they sought a natural
religion that followed the dictates of reason. The outcome was a variety of
radical departures from religious orthodoxy. Some became outright atheists,
denying the existence of God and denouncing religion as a tool of priests
and politicians. Others became agnostics, who neither affirmed nor denied
the existence of God. The majority were deist, willing to go along with
proposition that God existed and had created the universe but insisting
that, after the act of creation, God allowed the universe to function
according to certain natural laws and refrained from intervention. Thus the
deists were able to have their cake and eat it too. They could accept God
and the teaching of Christianity and at the same time reject supernatural
features such as the virgin birth, the resurrection, the divinity of Christ,
and the divine inspiration of the Bible. The important point to note is that
all these new dogmas =- atheism, agnosticism, deism –reflected the
unprecedented growth of skepticism regarding “revealed” or “supernatural”
religion. For the first time since the triumph of Christianity in Europe, a
definite break had occurred with the Christians tradition.
In government, also, the philosophers had a key phrase – “the social
contract.” The contract theory of government was not new. The English
political theorist Jon Locke ahd formulated it in his <em>Essay on Civil
Government</em> (1690), in which he defined government as a political contract
between rulers and ruled. But the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
transformed it into a social rather than a political contract. For him it
involved an agreement among the people themselves. In his major political
work, <em>The Social Contract</em>(1762), Rousseau viewed government as imply a
“commission,” by which he justified revolution as a restoration to the
sovereign people of its rightful power. – Page 433</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The declaration set forth certain fundamental mental principles concerning
liberty, property, and security – “Men are born, and always continue, free
and equal, in respect of their right … The Nation is essentially the
source of all sovereignty .. law is an expression of the will of the
community .. liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not injure
another …” – Page 443</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberal doctrines were first clearly formulated and implemented during the
English Revolution. At that time, these doctrines were primarily those of
religious toleration and of security of perosn and of property against the
arbitrariness of the crown. Specifically, carrying out these doctrines
involved parliamentary control of government, the existence of independent
political parties, and the recognition of the need for, and the rights of,
opposition parties. – Page 448</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Karl Max(1818 - 1883), the father of modern socialism, differed
fundamentally from the Utopian Socialists in almost every respect. he was as
materialistic in his outlook as they were idealistic. He spent most of his
life studying the historical evolution and the precise functioning of the
existing capitalist society, whereas Utopians prepared blueprints of
modern communities. Marx was convinced from his study of history that
capitalism would be overthrown by class struggle and would be overthrown by
class struggle and would be replaced by a new type of socialist society. He
reached this conclusion because he believed that the wages paid to workers
were insufficient for them to buy what they produced. This inadequate
purchasing power eventually must lead to the closing of factories,
unemployment, a further decline of purchasing power, and, at length, a
full-scale depression. Furthermore, Marx believed that these depressions
would become increasingly frequent and severe until finally the unemployed
proletariat would be driven in desperation to revolution. In this way
capitalism would be replaced by socialism, as feudalism earlier had been by
capitalism. And the new socialistic society would be depression-proof
because, with government ownership of the means of production, there could
be no private employers, no profits, and the hence no lack of purchasing
power. – Page 450</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why the yawning and expanding chasm between the utopia expected by some
scientists an d the actually existing dystopia? The answer is to be found
in our cultures. All cultures of all peoples consist of control mechanisms
designed to regulate the behavior of society members. The cultures evolved
gradually during the historical evolution of the societies and therefore
represented their survival wisdom. The values comprising the various
cultures were calculated to enhance community cohesion and
survival. Consequently the values commonly incorporated in cultures favored
maximum fertility for species perpetuation, maximum productivity for
economic sustenance, and maximum military strength for physical survival.<br />
Through the millennia, cultures became the essential underpinnings of their
respective societies. Only through their cultures did individuals know what
they could do and how to do it. Therefore any threat to cultural values
became as serious as any threat to together basic necessities such as food
and water. Hence the extreme reluctance to tolerate any substantive
alternation or modification of traditional values. Hence also the historic
persistence of cultural rigidity, even in periods such as the present, when
rapid technological innovations necessitate correspondingly rapid social
innovations. But technological change customarily has been accepted and
welcomed because it normally raises living standards, while cultural change
has been feared and resisted because it threatens traditional and
comfortable values and practices.<br />
This dichotomy has prevailed throughout history, resulting in the social
stagnation amid the technological storms of our own making. The
disconnection has been responsible for much of the chronic violence and
bloodshed that have stained human history. It persists to the present, when
the disconnection is impacting directly and ominously on many phases of our
lives, as manifested incessantly o television screens and in newspaper
headlines.  — Page 657</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>在知乎上发现的一篇奇文，记录于此。</p>

<p>南北战争是一件对美国历史无比重要的事。可以说，懂南北战争，懂美国大半。可见要说清楚是几乎不可能的。这里我也是努力借这个问题理清一下思路。</p>

<p>比如，南北战争的直接原因，看上去就是支持废奴的共和党候选人林肯当选，然后南方数州宣布独立，而北方诸州则以维护联邦统一为由，打起了这么一场统一与分裂的战争。</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>细一看，就会注意到，林肯在 1860 年大选时，只拿到了全国四成的选票，除了在 Vermont，在北方大部分州里，林肯只是拿了五六成的选票，而在南方他根本就没出现在选票上。也就是说，共和党作为一个地方性政党，获得了大选的胜利，而这胜利，也印证了前总统 Martin van Buren 在多年前的预言：执政党如果不能获得全国范围的支持，国家就会面临分裂。</p>

<p>于是，一个问题就变成了两个问题。北方人是真的都那么痛恨奴隶制么？南方人为什么如此的不能妥协，连上选票的机会都不给？要知道，林肯并非激进的废奴主义 者，而是共和党温和派。他只是道义上的废奴者，法律上还是支持南方奴隶主的合法权利的。如果事情是如此的水火不容，又为什么要拖到这么晚，为什么不在建国 之初解决？</p>

<p>事实是，在建国之时，冲突就已然存在。</p>

<p>作为受启蒙运动深深影响的一代，当时很多人看奴隶制已经是不顺眼的了。 杰斐逊在《独立宣言》里罗列了英国的种种罪状，其中有一条就是指责英国人把奴隶制强加给了我们。但是南方奴隶主们还挺老实，把这条给去掉了。其实杰斐逊也 明白这一点，所以他也不赞成废除奴隶制。独立战争期间，英国人就拿出了废奴这一招，号召黑奴叛逃，杰斐逊愤怒的谴责英国人这法子太过恶毒。因为长期的种植 园经济造成了南方对奴隶制的过度依赖，地方政治体系也呈现出严格的等级阶层结构。如果强行取消奴隶制，不仅这些种植园主无法接受带来的经济损失，即有的政 局也会被这些新近被解放的自由民带入太多的不确定性。</p>

<p>这也是一上来，美国就面临的一个困境。于是，废奴主义者选择了允许奴隶制的存在，只是努力限制其发展。他们的算盘是，因为奴隶适合的工作不多，所以随着奴隶人口的增加，只要奴隶制被地域限制住，效率必然会下降，这样奴隶制会自然消亡，大家就能和和气气的走向新时代。</p>

<p>但是，事与愿违，不久，轧棉机出现了，这样，棉花种植变成了相当有利可图的行业。商业用的棉花现在可以种植在南方的大部分土地上。而且，比起其它作物来，棉 花生产劳动强度低，男女老少都可以做。这样，种植园里的奴隶性别比例比较均衡，死亡率很低，能够保持奴隶家庭的完整，也就可以保持稳定的人口增长。于是到南北战争前夕，南方的奴隶总数已经有四百万，而奴隶的价格则一路彪升到 1800 美元（谢谢 @王劲松 指出错误），相当于一个普通技术工人三年的工资。所以，南方虽然可以蓄奴，大部分却养不起奴隶，绝大部分奴隶和随之而来的财富被掌握在少数人手里。虽然奴隶总数在增 加，生产效率则增加得更快，棉花种植生产的利润反而起来越高，于是南方的种植园主，成了美国最富有的人。而也由于种植园经济的巨大利润，让南方虽然越来越 富，却没有想过像北方那样发展工业等其它产业。</p>

<p>这样，奴隶制本身的重要性反而变得越来越高，改变越来越难。相比起来，因为经济制度而产生 的和其它地区的很多矛盾，其实都是可以商量的。比如在关税上，北方为了保护民族工业，要提高关税，而南方的大量生活生产用品都靠进口，当然希望降低关税。 在 1828 年通过让南方不爽的厌恶关税法（Tariff of Abominations）后，南方可以马上全力推选 Andrew Jackson 当选总统，并在 1832 年通过新税法，把关税降到了大部分州都可以接受的水平。从本质上说，关税啊，政府权力啊，都是些量上的分岐。但是在奴隶制上，奴隶一旦被解放，就无法再被 圈回，损失将是永久的，无法挽回的。因为这就像是私有制变公有制一样，是一个黑白分明的问题，根本没有任何试一试不行再改回来的可能。于是对于蓄奴州来 说，奴隶制本身就成了无可商量的话题。</p>

<p>但是，一个巴掌拍不响，南方人是铁了心拼了命要保护自己的奴隶制，但北方也得有宁为玉碎，不为瓦全 的心才行。光从点经济利益上，是犯不着要跟南方死磕的。比如要搞商业保护的，主要是工业。但金融业就从来是反对大政府的监管的。又比如北方的出口商，航 队，和港口，很大程度上都是靠南方的进出口吃饭的，这些人当然也是支持南方的奴隶制的。北方的新移民，也不想见到突然冒出来几百万廉价劳工，和他们抢工 作。而且，对于普通老百姓来说，低关税能降低物价，也不全是坏事。</p>

<p>这个，就要提到在十九世纪初期出现的第二次大觉醒（second awakening）了。</p>

<p>宗教大觉醒，是美国这个基督教国家不定期的宗教狂热症的一种表现。说不定期，是因为它是被社会环境的变化所催发的。而这个时期，正好是诸多社会因素开始撞击 传统的社会观念的时期。大量移民开始涌入，工业化刚有苗头，贫富差距开始显现，经济危机也随之而来，政治体系在民主党近乎一党专政下却充满了不确定性，人 们开始面对一个新的社会秩序，不同观念的冲撞。这时候，政教分离的原则让教会面临危机：没有政府的支持，教会更依赖会众的支持，但教会无法通过政府来赢取 会众。教会意识到，直接改变或影响社会本身已变得越来越难，与其说以教会的想法去整饬外部世界，不如进入内部的心灵世界，去改变每个教徒的心。于是，北方 教会开始主动出击，积极发展教众，这就是第二次大觉醒。</p>

<p>有二次，就有第一次。第一次大觉醒发生在十八世纪上半页，当时的牧师们受到欧洲宗 教潮流，尤其是英国的约翰•卫斯理和他的卫理宗的影响，走出教堂，到教区里向会众布道。到第二次大觉醒时，布道者更是走出自己教区，向所有民众传教，又遇 上社会在经济生活，文化生活和政治生活中遇到了种种问题，被吸纳进教会的会众人数开始飞速増长。于是，传教变成了一个大规模的社会活动，每次活动时，大批 教众从四方赶到指定地点进行团契，以集体方式接受宗教体验，完成个人救赎。</p>

<p>若说这大觉醒只是一次大规模布道，也不会产生如此巨大的影响。 第二次大觉醒对美国的深刻影响，在于它改变了北美清教徒的一些基本宗教观念。在清教徒的教义，最让人困惑的，是命定论，就是人皆有罪，虽然每人都要寻求救 赎，但是否能得救，却是前世命定，无法改变的。这样一来，很多事情就是做也不是，不做也不是。比如财富或许是上帝对你的肯定，也可能是你太贪婪而要被惩罚 的标志。为人正直固然可敬，但改变不了你的罪。但是在这第二次大觉醒中，越来越多的教徒接受了新的观念，就是相信罪是有现世的化身的，就是说一个人是否有 罪，能通过外在的有罪行为表现出来。所以只要能主动除罪，就能完成免罪的过程。这样的教义，是有巨大的现实能动性的。可以说在这次大觉醒后，美国的清教徒 已经和新教徒的基本理念慢慢趋向一致了。</p>

<p>在第二次大觉醒下，人们开始积极的面对那些所谓的社会上的罪。比如奴隶制，就是典型的人所犯下的 罪，废奴，也就成为社会完成自身救赎的重要标志。这种罪，当然是以加尔文新教的观念来看的。所以那些和新教教义矛盾的观念，也就首当其冲的被拿出来，作为 罪来解决。比如德国和爱尔兰移民爱喝酒，这就是罪，要去除。比如天主教是以教皇为首的从上而下的组织结构，和新教的会众式相悖，于是，为了表示对天主教徒 向教皇附首的蔑视，对个人自由与独立性的追求也被显著拨高了，爱默生和索罗在这时开始走红。另一方面，这样大规模的布道要进入生活的方方面面，教会开始接 受女性在传教中的作用，结果，女权运动开始兴起，女性开始积极介入禁酒废奴这样的社会活动。比如《汤姆叔叔的小屋》的作者 Harriet Beecher Stowe，她父亲就是著名长老会牧师 Lyman Beecher。 </p>

<p>有了巨大的教众群，教会也自然成为了重要的政治力量。 但要进入政治生活，把自己的政治诉求实现，还需要通过政党。在 1828 年，随着前面提到的 Andrew Jackson 上台，美国政坛开始了新的时代。Andrew Jackson 所在的民主党支持各州权利，实际就是南方各州维持奴隶制的权利。同时，在经济危机面前，民主党延续了它支持移民权益的态度，无论天主教新教，一视同仁，成 为社会最底层大众的保护者。民主党的这种强调道德自决的立场，北方教会自然无法认同。</p>

<p>这时候，北方出现了 Whig 党。Whig 党针对 Jackson 的民主革命，强调精英统治，以政府的力量保护民族工业发展。而工业的发展需要市场，市场的良好运作需要共同的道德标准，于是，Whig 党在北方教会对统一道德标准的想法上一拍既合，形成同盟。</p>

<p>不过到这时，废奴的问题依然只是在如何限制奴隶制发展上。</p>

<p>这是因为党派是要解决问题的，而不是制造问题的。要解决问题，就要拿下大选，要拿下，就要有全国性的支持，所以，像反对奴隶制这样的主张只能是在态度上，而 不能拿进党的纲领里。为了赢得南方的支持，Whig 党继续打精英牌，以拉拢南方的上层阶级，而种植园主为了北方出口商的支持，也有不少支持 Whig 党。</p>

<p>另一方面，废奴对于北方教会来说，也只是上面提到的诸多议题之一，非并全部，甚至不是最关键的。因为当时北方已经没有了奴隶制，所以 对于北方人来说，不断涌入的天主教移民才是大家生活中经常面对的问题。南方人担心如果废奴，大量自由黑人对传统政治平衡的冲击，而北方则已经开始面对不断 涌入的天主教徒。尤其是在 1820 年后各州逐渐对投票者解除地产要求，人人皆可投票，这些爱尔兰移民就迅速进入政界，推举自己的地方候选人，冲击盎格鲁－撒克逊人的主导地位。于是，针对天 主教徒的本土主义运动在北方更是风风火火，连续爆发了数次针对天主教徒的暴乱。而反对奴隶制的问题，很大程度上是个态度问题，普通人很少需要作出实质性表 态。只有少数激进主义者会去冒险搞地下铁路这样的秘密活动。</p>

<p>所以在奴隶制上的南北冲突，在 1830 年后的二十年间，还是延续着传统的解决方式，就是两个主要政党通过国会试图在立法上调解。而主要的冲突，如何限制奴隶制，则是在关于如何纳入新的州上。因 为一个州是否接受奴隶制，也是一个非黑即白的过程。矛盾的第一次爆发，是1820 年的密苏里妥协 （Missouri Compromise）。在这次妥协案中，双方同意以北纬 36.3度为界，划分蓄奴州和自由州。</p>

<p>但是这次妥协却无法解决动态平衡。民主 党坚持走农业帝国的路线，要不停的在领土上向西扩张，南方同时也就可以为奴隶制的发展提供空间。这种作法对于自耕农来说当然也是大受欢迎，因为农民最需要 的就是廉价土地。北方发展工业则需要集中资源，而不是扩张，结果新领土以农牧业生产为主，在北方实质上形成了一个新的政治区，就是西部，让美国政局呈现出 南北西三方博弈的格局。西部作为新进州，体制更民主，对北方政治传统造成冲击。于是，南部的积极西进就和北方的迟疑形成对比，南方大力扩张，自然会在国会 里索要更多的议席，更多的蓄奴州，也让废奴主义者的限制策略成为空谈。</p>

<p>矛盾的焦点，集中在德克萨斯州上。1836 年，德州在美国支持下独立，并在 45 年被纳入美国，并因此爆发了美墨战争。不出意料，Whig 党继续反对领土扩张的战争，可是全国的普通老百姓却是欢乎雀跃。结果，美国大胜，获得了从德州向西直达太平洋的大片土地。Whig 党在这场斗争中元气大伤，内部开始出现松动，北方的政局出现了变数。越来越多的废奴主义者开始认为这件事可能无法在现有的政治体系下被解决，“地下铁路” 这样的体制外的解决方案开始越来越受到肯定，公开支持废奴的政党也开始出现。</p>

<p>但是美墨战争赢下的土地还是要解决，于是，就有了 1850 年的妥协。在这次妥协中，加州作为一个自由州加入美国，南方则得到了针对地下铁路的逃奴法案。</p>

<p>逃奴法案里第一次明确要求了北方的警力有责任抓捕逃走的奴隶，否则要被重罚。这个法案看上去对南方是有利的，但是在政治上，却是一个致命的错误，可以说，南 北战争真有什么导火索的话，这是第一股火绳。在这以前，奴隶制对于北方人来说只是个外州的问题，逃奴法案的这一规定，却等于是把南方的奴隶制问题扩大到了 北方。这样的结果，让反对奴隶制的新教徒无法接受：本来是限制奴隶制的发展，结果限制半天限制到自己头上来了。于是，奴隶制问题一下取代了其它社会问题， 成了无法回避的头等大事。两年后，代表废奴主义者立场的《汤姆叔叔的小屋》诞生并大卖，而 Whig 党则在这个问题上信用全失，在大选中土崩瓦解。于是，通过党派在国会调解的方法，可以说是已经走上了死胡同。</p>

<p>Whig 党解体后，北方出现了政治真空，当然，也就有新的政党出来填补这个空白。这就是一无所知党（know-nothing party）。让人有点意外的是，一无所知党并非因为废奴而出现的，而是一个以反对新移民，尤其是天主教移民为中心的本土主义者党派。它能趁虚而入，很大 程度上是因为其组织结构。严格的说，一无所知党不是一个政党，而是一个（反对各种移民秘密结社的？）秘密结社组织，因为秘密，所以参加者都以对此党一无所 知来作答，因而得名。因为是秘密结社，所以一无所知党没有公开的党纲，可以在各地以相当灵活的方式介入当地政治事务。而在麻省对逃奴法案的反对情绪集中爆 发的时候，一无所知党以反对奴隶制的形象出现了，这就是 1854 年的 Anthony Burns 案。</p>

<p>Anthony Burns 是逃到波士顿的南方黑奴，在 1854 年 5 月被发现，要被依法遣返回南方。结果在新英格地区的人民一下子群情激昂，要求解放 Burns，而联邦政府则一定要立一个执法典范，于是四方废奴主义者纷纷赶来，逼政府出动军队来控制形式。波士顿没人愿意来作押送 Burns 的倒霉事，最后只好由和黑人势不两立的爱尔兰移民警队来执行。而支持废奴的一无所知党一时声威大振，党员在数月间就从五万人发展过百万，并在麻省的选举中 全面获胜。但是一无所知党起得快，落得也快。因为它倒底是以排外为中心的组织，所以在废奴上无法取得一致，结果无法应对废奴已经成了任何党派所要面对和解 决的头等大事这一现实，于是，像 Whig 党一样，迅速瓦解。</p>

<p>一无所知党以民间组织的形式崛起，标志着对奴隶制问题的探索进行到了新阶 段，就是让人民来自主解决蓄奴废奴问题。也正是此时，民主党参议员 Stephen Douglas（就是那位和林肯有过几次历史性辩论的著名参议员）提出了人民主权（popular sovereignty）的方式，就是由新进州举行全民公决，来决定是否成为蓄奴州，这就是 1854 年的 Kansas–Nebraska Act。它以立法形式宣布了党派调解的传统道路彻底破产。同一年，堪萨斯举行公决，结果，支持和反对蓄奴的组织从四方纷纷赶来投票，本来只有 1500 名注册选民的堪萨斯收到了超过 6000 张投票。在其后一段时间内，双方在堪萨斯和周遭地界发生大规模冲突，落下了“流血的堪萨斯（Bleeding Kansas）”的名声。</p>

<p>流血的堪萨斯让人民自决的方法刚刚冒头，就已经看不到希望，而西部还有大量悬而未决的领土，未来发展显然要面对 更大的不确定性。而 1856 年，南方的民主党议员 Preston Brooks 为此在国会山上杖击了了麻省参议员，激进的废奴主义者 Charles Sumner，这一粗暴行为，为南北双方赢得了各自的一名英雄，但也宣布了国会已经不可能再为解决这个问题提供可能。</p>

<p>雪上加霜的是次年的 Dred Scott vs Standford 案。黑奴 Dred Scott 在 1846 年起诉说自己应该是自由人，理由是他曾随主人前往自由州伊利诺伊州居住，所以就应该自动成为自由人。这样说也非 Scott 自己的发明。比如已经废除奴隶制的英国就有此规定，以至于南方奴隶主从此不敢把自己的奴隶带往英国了。Scott 的官司一直打到高院。高院首席大法官 Roger B. Taney 来自蓄奴州马里兰，在他主持下的高院认定 Scott 还是奴隶，理由是 Scott 作为一名奴隶，是私人财产，根本就没有权利发起此诉讼，而且，既然是私人财产，怎么能跑到别的地方这个财产就被自动剥夺了呢？Taney 认为，自己的这个光辉决定从此一了百了的解决了奴隶制问题，但却成为高院史上数一数二的荒诞判决。这下子北方的那些民间努力都是白费，社会各种不确定性更 加突显。于是，高院这条路，也被封死了。</p>

<p>自此，在短短几年间，国会，高院，全民公决，上上下下这三条道路都已经走尽。</p>

<p>接下来，把希望彻底断掉的那个人，叫约翰•布朗（John Brown）。</p>

<p>约翰•布朗也是北方的激进废奴份子。他在“流血的堪萨斯”时就是不远万里从北方赶来废奴的一员。在此之后，他继续努力，带了 20 来个人，1859 年在当时的弗吉尼亚州的 Harpers Ferry 试图发动武装暴动，被抓，受审，被处死。这事作为民间草根运动，跟地下铁路这种事本无本质区别。但是在他被捕后，南方政府发现，他的行动获得了北方六名著 名废奴主义者的财政支持，其中，有几个人还是一直主张要和平解决奴隶制问题的。这下子南方就彻底对北方废奴主义者绝望了。</p>

<p>然后，就是 1860 年的大选，和共和党的胜利。</p>

<p>共和党是在 1854 年踩着 Kansas–Nebraska Act 的尸体在中西部诞生的。林肯和他的党内领袖意识到，长期以来大量移民的迁入，让北方保持了比南方快 50％ 的人口翻倍速度，到 1860 年，北方的选民数量大大超过南方。这样，只要把北方和西部联合起来，就能拿下大选。而同时，西部开始和北部有更多的共同语言。从经济上讲，北方的工业已经 初具规模，现在，他们需要西部加入到北方创造的这个大市场来，而西部的农业发展也需要铁路这样的基础建设的支持，东部资金的注入，这时候，在奴隶制存废上 的不稳定性就成为了东部和西部的一个共同话题。林肯卓越的政治洞查力让他明白，排外在中西部虽然还是重要的社会议题，但却会让共和党无法赢取到相当依靠移 民的北方。于是，共和党把排外的主张淡化在纲领之外，只一力强调反对奴隶制这个共同的底线，从而建立了一个联合北方的统一阵线。而在同时，民主党则在奴隶 制上自己产生了分裂，以至于推出了南北两个候选人。</p>

<p>结果就是，林肯胜出。</p>

<p>但是南方经过前面的一系列事件，已经无法信任林肯这样一个在法律上承认南方奴隶制的温和派了。</p>

<p>于是，分裂在即，南北战争爆发。</p>
