    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All those years of studying philosophy, religion, science, history and all the
experience that I will not try to list here, it leads me to think that
consciousness is an emergent phenomenon. I just asked myself, if human beings
are designed, and within current framework of Artificial Intelligence Research,
the source power of consciousness is the optimization of certain functions.</p>

<p>Inspired by the Three Laws of Robots, three optimization functions for human
race came into my mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A human must ensure its own gene and spirit ‘s survival on the first
priority.</li>
  <li>A human must ensure its own race’s survival on the first priority given the
rules listed numerically above are obeyed.</li>
  <li>A human must pursue the intellectual understanding of the universe on the
first priority given the rules listed numerically above are obeyed.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I will revise it when I have some other ideas.</p>

<p>For those who want to consider it seriously, don’t.</p>
