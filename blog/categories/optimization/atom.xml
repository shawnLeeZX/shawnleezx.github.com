<p>Denote the matrix of a linear mapping $T$ corresponds to natural bases as $A$,
then $A^{T}$ is the matrix corresponds to the dual map of $T$. Now suppose $A
\in R^{M \times N}$.</p>

<p>For a linear programming problem, the constraints are $Ax \leq b$, intuitively,
we understand it as a polyhedron, the intersection of finite number of
halfspaces.</p>

<p>We could also understand it from linear mapping and dual bases point of view.</p>

<p>$A$ maps points from $R^{N}$ to $R^{M}$. A column of $A$ corresponds to the
coordinates of the an natural basis of $R^{N}$ in the new $R^{M}$, meanwhile,
a column of $A^{T}$, which is a row of $A$, corresponds to the coordinates of a
dual basis of a natural basis of $R^{M}$ in $R^{N}$ if it is transformed by
$A^{T}$.</p>

<p>So a row $\vec{a_{i}}$ of $A$ is a $A^{T}$ transformed dual basis that
corresponds to one natural basis in $R^{M}$, which corresponds to a hyperplane
in $R^{N}$, also an element of the dual space of $R^{N}$.</p>

<p>From this perspective, the polyhedron in $R^{N}$ is a squashed(or enlarged)
quadrant of $R^{M}$, which is the intersection of hyperplanes whose normals are
natural bases of $R^{M}$ â€” the hyperplanes only need to pass a constant
value, probably corresponding dimension of $b$(have not thought very clearly),
do not necessarily pass origin point.</p>

<p>If $M &gt; N$, $R^{M}$ gets squashed, and there are much freedom in the way how
the space gets squashed, which is analog with we have more equations than
variables, so it is easier to get solutions. Otherwise, $R^{M}$ gets enlarged,
however, no matter how the enlarging is done, it still remains as a low
dimensional space in the high dimensional space, thus the freedom is limited,
which is analog with more variables than equations, so it is harder or
impossible to get solutions.</p>
