<h2 id="the-fields">The fields</h2>

<p>The fields that may be used within a bibliographic entry are listed below
together with their meanings. They are always given in the form:</p>

<p>field name = {field text}</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>field name = “field text”</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>address</strong>: The address of the publisher or other institution. For major
publishing houses, it is sufficient to give just the city. For smaller
publishers, giving the full address is recommended.</li>
  <li><strong>annote</strong>: An annotation that may be used by non-standard bibliography styles to
produce an annotated bibliography. The standard BIBTEX styles ignore it.</li>
  <li><strong>author</strong>: The name(s) of the author(s).</li>
  <li><strong>booktitle</strong> The title of a book when only part of it is being cited.</li>
  <li><strong>chapter</strong>: A chapter or section number.</li>
  <li><strong>crossref</strong>: The key of another entry in the database that shares many of the
same field entries.</li>
  <li><strong>edition</strong>: The edition of a book, usually written in full and capitalized, as
‘Second’. The standard styles will change it to lower case as necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>editor</strong>: The name(s) of the editor(s). If there is also an author field, then
this gives the editor of the book or collection in which the citation appears.</li>
  <li><strong>howpublished</strong>: States anything unusual about the method of publishing. Should
be capitalized. Example: ‘Privately published’.</li>
  <li><strong>institution</strong>: The name of the sponsoring institution for a technical report.</li>
  <li>journal The name of a journal or magazine. Abbreviations are provided for the
most common ones.</li>
  <li><strong>key</strong>: An addition for alphabetizing purposes when the author infor- mation is
missing. This is not the same as the key for identifying the entry to a \cite
command.</li>
  <li><strong>month</strong>: The month in which the work was published or, if unpublished, when it
was written. Abbreviations exist in the form of the first three letters of the
(English) names.</li>
  <li><strong>note</strong>: Any additional information that should be added. Capitalize the first
letter.</li>
  <li><strong>number</strong>: The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or work in a
series. Journals are usually identified by volume and number; technical
reports are issued a number by the institution; books in series sometimes have
a number given to them.</li>
  <li><strong>organization</strong>: The sponsoring organization for a conference or a manual.</li>
  <li><strong>pages</strong>: A page number or a range of pages, in the form 32,41,58 or 87–101 or
68+. The last form indicates page 68 and following pages. A single hyphen
given for a range will be converted by the standard styles to the double
hyphen to produce a dash, as ‘87–101’.</li>
  <li><strong>publisher</strong>: The publisher’s name.</li>
  <li><strong>school</strong>: The name of the academic institution where a thesis was written.
series The name of a series or set of books. When citing a book from a series,
the title field gives the name of the book itself while the optional series
specifies the title of whole set.</li>
  <li><strong>title</strong>: The title of the work, obeying the capitalization rules listed in</li>
  <li><strong>type</strong>: The type of technical report, for example, ‘Research Note’.</li>
  <li><strong>url</strong>: The universal resource locator, or Internet address, for online documents;
this is not standard but supplied by more modern bibliography styles.</li>
  <li><strong>volume</strong>: The volume number of a journal or multi-volume book.</li>
  <li><strong>year</strong>: The year in which the work was published or, if unpublished, in which it
was written. It should normally consist of four numerals, such as 1993.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional field names may be included, which BIBTEX will simply
ignore. For example, to add the abstract of an article in the database,</p>

<p>abstract = {text of an abstract}</p>

<p>This can be of use in other applications as well as for database manage-
ment.</p>
