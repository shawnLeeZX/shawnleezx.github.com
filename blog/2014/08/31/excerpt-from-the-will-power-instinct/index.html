    <p>This excerpt is the final chapter of the book,
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Willpower-Instinct-Self-Control-Matters/dp/1583335080/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409490772&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+will+power+instinct">The Will Power Instinct</a></em>,
which summarizes the points in the book.</p>

<p>To try to make the summary more compact, I may summary it into the
following points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The book utilizes the discoveries from neuroscience, which gives a
simple explanation of the mechanism how human brain works. With
such understanding, it tries to understand self control and makes it
work.</li>
  <li>The key point to self control is you have something to pursue,
fight for or want to protect, which is described as <em>I want</em> power
in the book.</li>
</ol>

<p>We started our journey together in the savannah of the Serengeti,
being chased by a saber-toothed tiger. Now we find ourselves here, on
the last few pages, ending our tour. Along the way, we’ve seen chimps
display extraordinary self-control, and quite a few humans lose
control. We’ve visited laboratories where dieters must resist
chocolate cake, and anxiety sufferers must face their fears. We’ve
watched as neuroscientists discovered the promise of reward, and
neuromarketers discovered its payoff. We’ve come across interventions
that use pride, forgiveness, exercise, meditation, peer pressure,
money, sleep, and even God to motivate people to change their
ways. We’ve met psychologists who shock rats, torture smokers, and
tempt four-year-olds with marshmallows —all in the name of the science
of willpower.</p>

<p>I hope this tour has provided more than a voyeur’s glimpse into the
fascinating world of research. Each of these studies teaches us
something about ourselves and our own willpower challenges. They help
us recognize our natural capacity for self-control, even if we
sometimes struggle to use it. They help us understand our failures and
point at possible solutions. They even tell us something about what it
means to be human. For example, we’ve seen again and again that we are
not one self, but multiple selves. Our human nature includes both the
self that wants immediate gratification, and the self with a higher
purpose. We are born to be tempted, and born to resist. It is just as
human to feel stressed, scared, and out of control as it is to find
the strength to be calmand in charge of our choices. Self-control is a
matter of understanding these different parts of ourselves, not
fundamentally changing who we are. In the quest for self-control, the
usual weapons we wield against ourselves—guilt, stress, and
shame—don’t work. People who have the greatest self-control aren’t
waging self-war. They have learned to accept and integrate these
competing selves.</p>

<p>If there is a secret for greater self-control, the science points to
one thing: the power of paying attention. It’s training the mind to
recognize when you’re making a choice, rather than running on
autopilot. It’s noticing how you give yourself permission to
procrastinate, or how you use good behavior to justify
self-indulgence. It’s realizing that the promise of reward doesn’t
always deliver, and that your future self is not a superhero or a
stranger. It’s seeing what in your world—from sales gimmicks to social
proof—is shaping your behavior. It’s staying put and sensing a craving
when you’d rather distract yourself or give in. It’s remembering what
you really want, and knowing what really makes you feel
better. Self-awareness is the one “self ” you can always count on to
help you do what is difficult, and what matters most. And that is the
best definition of willpower I can think of.</p>
