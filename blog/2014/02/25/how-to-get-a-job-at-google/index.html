    <p>This is a article from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-to-get-a-job-at-google.html?_r=1">here</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the benefits from the catching title, what the article talks about is
actually what google want is a integrated person. Enjoy reading.</p>

<p>Now, begins the article.</p>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — LAST June, in an interview with Adam Bryant of The
Times, Laszlo Bock, the senior vice president of people operations for Google —
i.e., the guy in charge of hiring for one of the world’s most successful
companies — noted that Google had determined that “G.P.A.’s are worthless as a
criteria for hiring, and test scores are worthless. … We found that they
don’t predict anything.” He also noted that the “proportion of people without
any college education at Google has increased over time” — now as high as 14
percent on some teams. At a time when many people are asking, “How’s my kid
gonna get a job?” I thought it would be useful to visit Google and hear how
Bock would answer.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Don’t get him wrong, Bock begins, “Good grades certainly don’t hurt.” Many jobs
at Google require math, computing and coding skills, so if your good grades
truly reflect skills in those areas that you can apply, it would be an
advantage. But Google has its eyes on much more.</p>

<p>“There are five hiring attributes we have across the company,” explained Bock.
“If it’s a technical role, we assess your coding ability, and half the roles in
the company are technical roles. For every job, though, the No. 1 thing we look
for is general cognitive ability, and it’s not I.Q. It’s learning ability. It’s
the ability to process on the fly. It’s the ability to pull together disparate
bits of information. We assess that using structured behavioral interviews that
we validate to make sure they’re predictive.”</p>

<p>The second, he added, “is leadership — in particular emergent leadership as
opposed to traditional leadership. Traditional leadership is, were you
president of the chess club? Were you vice president of sales? How quickly did
you get there? We don’t care. What we care about is, when faced with a problem
and you’re a member of a team, do you, at the appropriate time, step in and
lead. And just as critically, do you step back and stop leading, do you let
someone else? Because what’s critical to be an effective leader in this
environment is you have to be willing to relinquish power.”</p>

<p>What else? Humility and ownership. “It’s feeling the sense of responsibility,
the sense of ownership, to step in,” he said, to try to solve any problem — and
the humility to step back and embrace the better ideas of others. “Your end
goal,” explained Bock, “is what can we do together to problem-solve. I’ve
contributed my piece, and then I step back.”</p>

<p>And it is not just humility in creating space for others to contribute, says
Bock, it’s “intellectual humility. Without humility, you are unable to learn.”
It is why research shows that many graduates from hotshot business schools
plateau. “Successful bright people rarely experience failure, and so they don’t
learn how to learn from that failure,” said Bock.</p>

<p>Camille S. Yesterday Interesting that they claim GPA is worthless in the
recruiting process. When my 55 year old dad applied for a programming job at
Google… Roger Wright Yesterday This peek at the future is terrifying to most
corporate hiring execs. Too “soft and squishy.” It’s also business as usual
among top tier… Smartysmom Yesterday It’s clear why most of the comment
writers don’t work at Google, or any other interesting job. They’re
clueless.Wonder if this is what… SEE ALL COMMENTS “They, instead, commit the
fundamental attribution error, which is if something good happens, it’s because
I’m a genius. If something bad happens, it’s because someone’s an idiot or I
didn’t get the resources or the market moved. … What we’ve seen is that the
people who are the most successful here, who we want to hire, will have a
fierce position. They’ll argue like hell. They’ll be zealots about their point
of view. But then you say, ‘here’s a new fact,’ and they’ll go, ‘Oh, well, that
changes things; you’re right.’ ” You need a big ego and small ego in the same
person at the same time.</p>

<p>The least important attribute they look for is “expertise.” Said Bock: “If you
take somebody who has high cognitive ability, is innately curious, willing to
learn and has emergent leadership skills, and you hire them as an H.R. person
or finance person, and they have no content knowledge, and you compare them
with someone who’s been doing just one thing and is a world expert, the expert
will go: ‘I’ve seen this 100 times before; here’s what you do.’ ” Most of the
time the nonexpert will come up with the same answer, added Bock, “because most
of the time it’s not that hard.” Sure, once in a while they will mess it up, he
said, but once in a while they’ll also come up with an answer that is totally
new. And there is huge value in that.</p>

<p>To sum up Bock’s approach to hiring: Talent can come in so many different forms
and be built in so many nontraditional ways today, hiring officers have to be
alive to every one — besides brand-name colleges. Because “when you look at
people who don’t go to school and make their way in the world, those are
exceptional human beings. And we should do everything we can to find those
people.” Too many colleges, he added, “don’t deliver on what they promise. You
generate a ton of debt, you don’t learn the most useful things for your life.
It’s [just] an extended adolescence.”</p>

<p>Google attracts so much talent it can afford to look beyond traditional
metrics, like G.P.A. For most young people, though, going to college and doing
well is still the best way to master the tools needed for many careers. But
Bock is saying something important to them, too: Beware. Your degree is not a
proxy for your ability to do any job. The world only cares about — and pays off
on — what you can do with what you know (and it doesn’t care how you learned
it). And in an age when innovation is increasingly a group endeavor, it also
cares about a lot of soft skills — leadership, humility, collaboration,
adaptability and loving to learn and re-learn. This will be true no matter
where you go to work.</p>
