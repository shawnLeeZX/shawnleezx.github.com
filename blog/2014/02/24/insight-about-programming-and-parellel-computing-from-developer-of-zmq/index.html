    <p>Just watched the advertisement about a competition organized by Google some
days ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WHAT DO YOU LOVE?<br />
WHAT ARE YOU GOOD AT?<br />
WHAT DO YOUR WANT TO CHANGE?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a reason that people love the thing they love. I did not understand
why people is doing research on parallel computing times ago. This article is a
great inspiration.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-the-world">Fixing the World</h2>

<p>Programming is science dressed up as art because most of us don’t understand
the physics of software and it’s rarely, if ever, taught. The physics of
software is not algorithms, data structures, languages and abstractions. These
are just tools we make, use, throw away. The real physics of software is the
physics of people—specifically, our limitations when it comes to complexity,
and our desire to work together to solve large problems in pieces. This is the
science of programming: make building blocks that people can understand and use
easily, and people will work together to solve the very largest problems.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>We live in a connected world, and modern software has to navigate this world.
So the building blocks for tomorrow’s very largest solutions are connected and
massively parallel. It’s not enough for code to be “strong and silent” any
more. Code has to talk to code. Code has to be chatty, sociable,
well-connected. Code has to run like the human brain, trillions of individual
neurons firing off messages to each other, a massively parallel network with no
central control, no single point of failure, yet able to solve immensely
difficult problems. And it’s no accident that the future of code looks like the
human brain, because the endpoints of every network are, at some level, human
brains.</p>

<p>If you’ve done any work with threads, protocols, or networks, you’ll realize
this is pretty much impossible. It’s a dream. Even connecting a few programs
across a few sockets is plain nasty when you start to handle real life
situations. Trillions? The cost would be unimaginable. Connecting computers is
so difficult that software and services to do this is a multi-billion dollar
business.</p>

<p>So we live in a world where the wiring is years ahead of our ability to use it.
We had a software crisis in the 1980s, when leading software engineers like
Fred Brooks believed there was no “Silver Bullet” to “promise even one order of
magnitude of improvement in productivity, reliability, or simplicity”.</p>

<p>Brooks missed free and open source software, which solved that crisis, enabling
us to share knowledge efficiently. Today we face another software crisis, but
it’s one we don’t talk about much. Only the largest, richest firms can afford
to create connected applications. There is a cloud, but it’s proprietary. Our
data and our knowledge is disappearing from our personal computers into clouds
that we cannot access and with which we cannot compete. Who owns our social
networks? It is like the mainframe-PC revolution in reverse.</p>

<p>We can leave the political philosophy for another book. The point is that while
the Internet offers the potential of massively connected code, the reality is
that this is out of reach for most of us, and so large interesting problems (in
health, education, economics, transport, and so on) remain unsolved because
there is no way to connect the code, and thus no way to connect the brains that
could work together to solve these problems.</p>

<p>There have been many attempts to solve the challenge of connected code. There
are thousands of IETF specifications, each solving part of the puzzle. For
application developers, HTTP is perhaps the one solution to have been simple
enough to work, but it arguably makes the problem worse by encouraging
developers and architects to think in terms of big servers and thin, stupid
clients.</p>

<p>So today people are still connecting applications using raw UDP and TCP,
proprietary protocols, HTTP, and Websockets. It remains painful, slow, hard to
scale, and essentially centralized. Distributed P2P architectures are mostly
for play, not work. How many applications use Skype or Bittorrent to exchange
data?</p>

<p>Which brings us back to the science of programming. To fix the world, we needed
to do two things. One, to solve the general problem of “how to connect any code
to any code, anywhere”. Two, to wrap that up in the simplest possible building
blocks that people could understand and use easily.</p>

<p>It sounds ridiculously simple. And maybe it is. That’s kind of the whole point.</p>
