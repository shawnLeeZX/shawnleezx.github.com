    <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>My journey of teaching myself mathematics begins with learning the
number theory, understanding why matrix is invented. Thus up to now,
most of the effort was spent on matrix algebra and matrix calculus.</p>

<p>Recently, I am trying to understand wavelet theory. The main
motivation behind it is to find a set of basis to approximate
functions, which seems to involve a lot of analysis. Therefore, I
beginning to teach myself analysis like a math major student from
scratch.</p>

<p>The first hard concept I met is the construction of real number
system. I skipped this concept the first time I am learning
analysis. In retrospect, I mainly focused on the concept of peano
axiom to construct natural number system then because matrix algebra
mainly deals with integer. However, the main objective of wavelet
theory is to find a set of basis that can approximate functions,
regardless of continuous and discrete. There is no escape this time.</p>

<p>The articles about peano axiom is on another PDF file, which I haven’t
sorted it out on the blog. Some time in the future.</p>

<p>I guess this will be the beginning of a series of post about
analysis. The first one here is about construction of real number
system. Let us begin.</p>

<h2 id="some-words">Some Words</h2>

<p>The purpose of this post is to explain the intuition behind to
construct the real number system, so it will not be mathematically
sound and incremental. You should be familiar with the following
concept:</p>

<ol>
  <li>(ordered)field</li>
  <li>ordered set</li>
  <li>some knowledge about set and set operation</li>
  <li>Cauchy sequence</li>
  <li>Archimedean property</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="motivation-sketch">Motivation Sketch</h2>

<p>The following are key points that motivate mathematicians to construct
a new number theory that is called real number system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are numbers that rational number cannot incorporate. In other
word, there is gaps in rational number line.</li>
  <li>It may be surprising that for some $E \subset Q$, you cannot find
the extreme point of $E$ in $Q$.  This point is somehow a rephrase
of the previous point – there are gaps and least upper bound may
residue in the gap.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, to make the number line to be without gaps, in our daily
word, continuous, the real number system is constructed.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="folk-story">Folk Story</h2>

<p>For most practical purposes in our daily life, the Field of Rational
can be said to be more than adequate as a number system. After all,
when we take a measurement with our ruler, we can read at best to the
markings on the ruler and those markings are simply fractions of the
length of the ruler. Even when we use an electronic calculator and
obtained a result whose figures covered the whole screen, we simply
round off to our desired accuracy with not much complaint. Now, when
we round off something, we are simply getting a result that can be
expressed as a fraction. So what exactly is wrong with the Field of
Rational?</p>

<p>Most people’s idealization of the real numbers is that they are
markings on an imaginary number line. This number line is a sort of
conceptual ruler that mathematicians can use to measure their abstract
objects exactly. This means that the number line will always give us
the exact value, and not just any approximated value, of any quantity
we are measuring. Of course, some sort of standardization of the
division mark should be used so that everybody’s absolute value agree
but that is beside the point. Now, if the Field of Rational gives us
such an ideal number system, then we should be able to cover the whole
of the number line with rational numbers.  If this cannot be achieved,
then there will be at least one point on the number line that have no
markings, and what value are we going to assign an object whose length
happen to hit that mark?</p>

<h2 id="inadequacy-of-q">Inadequacy of $Q$</h2>

<h3 id="gap-in-q">Gap in $Q$</h3>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: There exists no rational $r$ such that $r^{2} = 2$.</p>

<p>Suppose that such $r$ does exist. We may assume that $r &gt; 0$,
otherwise we take $-r$.</p>

<p>Any rational number could be expressed in the form of $\frac{n}{m}$,
great command divisor of $m, n$ will be one, thus $n$ and $m$ will not
be both even.</p>

<p>so we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{n^{2}}{m^{2}} = 2
  n^{2} = 2m^{2}</script>

<p>In the equation above, $n^{2}$ will be even, thus $n$ will be
even. Consequently, $m$ will be even, which contradict with the
prerequisite that $n, m$ will not be both even.</p>

<p>Therefore, $r$ will not belong to $Q$.</p>

<h2 id="no-extremum-point-in-some-set-in-q">No extremum point in some set in $Q$</h2>

<p>To see this, we also consider the example of square root of 2.</p>

<p>For every $p$ in $A$ we can find a rational $q$ in $A$ such that $p &lt;
q$ and for every $p$ in $B$ we can find a rational $q$ in $B$ such
that $q &lt; p$.</p>

<p>To do this, we associate with each rational $p &gt; 0$ the number</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">q = p - \frac{p^{2} - 2}{p + 2} = \frac{2p + 2}{p + 2}</script>

<p>Then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">q^{2} - 2 = \frac{2(p^{2} - 2)}{(p + 2)^{2}}</script>

<p>If $p$ is in $A$ then $p^{2} - 2 &lt; 0$, we have $q &gt; p$ and $q \in
A$. The case when $p$ is in $B$ is visa vice.</p>

<p>From this example, we find that we cannot find the maximum of one set
in $Q$, which contradict with our intuition that the number line is
continuous. To make the number line continuous, the real number system
is constructed.</p>

<h2 id="least-upper-bound-property">least-upper-bound property</h2>

<p>Before we construct the real number system, we first define some
relevant definition.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> Suppose $S$ is an ordered set, and $E \subset S$. If
  there exists a $\beta \in S$ such that $x \leq \beta$ for every $x
  \in E$, we say that $E$ is bounded above, and call $\beta$ an <em>upper
  bound</em> of $E$.</p>

<p>Lower bound is defined in the same way.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> Suppose $S$ is an ordered set, $E \subset S$, and $E$
  is bounded above. Suppose there exists an $\alpha \in S$ with the
  following properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$\alpha$ is an upper bound of $E$.</li>
  <li>If $\gamma &lt; \alpha$ then $\gamma$ is not an upper bound of $E$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then $\alpha$ is called the <em>least upper bound</em> of $E$ or supremum of
$E$, and we write</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\alpha = sup E</script>

<p>The <em>greatest lower bound</em> or <em>infimum</em>, of a set $E$ which is bounded
below is defined in the same manner, denoted as $\alpha = inf E$.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> An ordered set $S$ is said to have the
  <em>least-upper-bound property</em> if the following is true:</p>

<p>If $E \subset S$, $E$ is not empty, and $E$ is bounded above, then
$sup E$ exists in $S$.</p>

<h2 id="real-number-system">Real Number System</h2>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> There exists an ordered field $R$ which has the
  least-upper-bound property.</p>

<p>The members of $R$ is are called <em>real numbers</em>.</p>

<p>Now we stop for a moment and to reiterate the understanding one should
possess when reaching this point. The gaps in rational number line
motivate mathematicians to construct real number system $R$, and the
most essential traits which makes $R$ different from $Q$ is that $R$
has least-upper-bound property, which means it has its extreme in its
own.</p>

<p>So, how could we construct such a system, called real number
system by us, that fulfills least-upper-bound property?</p>

<p>The intuition of two approaches will sketched. The first one is
Cantor’s approach and the second one is Dedekind’s approach. Cantor’s
approach is described first since it is easier for me to understanding
when learning.</p>

<h3 id="cantors-approach">Cantor’s Approach</h3>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> Let $\Gamma$ denote the set of all Cauchy sequences in
  $Q$. We say <script type="math/tex">(r_{n}), (s_{n}) \in \Gamma</script> are equivalent and we
  write <script type="math/tex">(r_{n}) ~ (s_{n})</script> if given any rational $\epsilon &gt; 0$,
  $\exists k \in N$ such that <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
|r_{n} - s_{n}| < \epsilon, \forall n \geq k %]]></script>.</p>

<p>We denote the equivalent class $[r_{k}]$.</p>

<p>Thus real number is defined by pushing rational number to their
limit. Each equivalent class in the sequence described above is a real
number. All of them is denoted as $R$.</p>

<p>If $R$ is going to be an ordered field, it must have its
properties. It could be proved that it indeed does. Here those proof
will be skipped because they are rather tedious and only one proof
will be showed, which is the problem real number system is created to
solve.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> The least upper bound property holds in $R$.</p>

<p>The main intuition behind this proof is that we can always find a
Cauchy sequence that is arbitrary close to the real number point we
want. It use a power of two as the sequence, if we takes a power of
ten, it is similar with our decimal point system.</p>

<p>Let $A$ be a nonempty subset of $R$ that is bounded above by, say,
$m$. Then by the Archimedean property, we can find $M \in Z$ with $m
\leq M$. Let $a$ be in $A$ and let $n$ be an integer with $n &lt; a$. For
$p \in N$ set <script type="math/tex">S_{p} = \{k2^{-p} | k \in Z\ and\ n \leq k2^{-p} \leq M\} \cup \{m\}</script>.
 Note that <script type="math/tex">S_{p} \neq \emptyset</script> and is finite. Now let
<script type="math/tex">a_{p} = min \{x | x \in S_{p}\ and\ x\ is\ an\ upper\ bound\ for\ A\}</script>.</p>

<p>Note that if $p &lt; q$, then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
a_{p} - 2^{-p} < a_{q} \leq a_{p} %]]></script>

<p>The intuition behind this is that as $p$ becomes larger, the granuity
of $k2^{-p}$ becomes finer.</p>

<p>Since, for example, <script type="math/tex">a_{p} - 2^{-p}</script> is not an upper bound for $A$,
while <script type="math/tex">a_{q}</script> is an upper bound. But this implies that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
|a_{p} - a_{q}| \leq 2^{-p} for\ all\ p < q %]]></script>

<p>from which it follows that <script type="math/tex">{a_{k}}_{k \in N}</script> is a Cauchy
sequence. Let $L = [a_{k}]$</p>

<p>We claim that $L$ is a least upper bound for $A$. Suppose $x \in A$
and $x &gt; L$. Choose $p$ such that $2^{-p} &lt; (x - L)$(using the
Archimedean property). Since <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
a_{p} - 2^{-p} < a_{q} %]]></script> for $p &lt; q$ and
<script type="math/tex">{a_{p}}_{p \in N}</script> is a decreasing Cauchy sequence, it follows that
<script type="math/tex">a_{p} - 2^{-p} \leq L</script>, we obtain <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
a_{p} < x %]]></script>, which is a
contradiction. Therefore, $L$ is an upper bound for $A$.</p>

<p>Suppose that $H$ is an upper bound for $A$ and that $H &lt; L$. Choose
$p$ such that $2^{-p} &lt; L - H$. Take $x \in A$ such that <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
a_{p} - 2^{-p} < x %]]></script>.
 Then <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
a_{p} - 2^{-p} < x %]]></script>. Then <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
a_{p} - 2^{-p} < H %]]></script>.
 Adding, we get <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
a_{p} < L %]]></script>. But, as noted above, $L \leq a{p}$ for
all $p \in N$, so this is a contradiction.</p>

<h3 id="dedekind-cut">Dedekind Cut</h3>

<p>Since Dedekind’s approach is at least as complex as Cantor’s approach,
only the intuition behind the construction is presented below:</p>

<p>Dedekind viewed each point, $x$, on the number line as a cut that
split the rational into 2 sets.</p>
