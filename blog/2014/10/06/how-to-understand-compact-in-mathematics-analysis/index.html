    <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>My journey of teaching myself mathematics begins with learning the
number theory, understanding why matrix is invented. Thus up to now,
most of the effort was spent on matrix algebra and matrix calculus.</p>

<p>Recently, I am trying to understand wavelet theory. The main
motivation behind it is to find a set of basis to approximate
functions, which seems to involve a lot of analysis. Therefore, I
beginning to teach myself analysis like a math major student from
scratch.</p>

<p>This post is about another concept called <strong>compact</strong>. You can find
previous post about real number system <a href="/blog/2014/09/30/why-and-how-we-construct-real-number-system/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> A subset $K$ of metric space $X$ is said to be
  <em>compact</em> if every open cover of $K$ contains a finite subcover.</p>

<p>As a number of other mathematical definition, they have reused the
structure built before, which means they have a lot of information
beneath the surface. So let’s define what is</p>

<ol>
  <li>metric space, this one is assumed to be known.</li>
  <li>open cover</li>
  <li>finite</li>
  <li>subcover</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="open-cover">open cover</h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> By an <em>open cover</em> of a set $E$ in a metric space $X$
  we mean a collection <script type="math/tex">\{G_{\alpha}\}</script> of open subsets of $X$ such
  that <script type="math/tex">E \subset \cup_{\alpha}G_{\alpha}</script>.</p>

<p><em>The concept of open is assumed to be known.</em></p>

<p>It is a rather mathematical definition, however, as having been
emphasized over and over, there is always a simple intuition behind
one abstract idea. The intuition of open cover is to use open, which
means we do not make arbitrary judgement about the boundary of the
ball ball to cover the area that is taken up by the $E$. The idea of
compact is to accumulate those no judgemental balls to acquire some
global properties about the set. As we will see later.</p>

<h3 id="subcover">subcover</h3>

<p>A subcover is one element of <script type="math/tex">G_{\alpha}</script>. The intuition is that one
subcover is just one open ball.</p>

<h2 id="finite">finite</h2>

<p>Though the concept of finite and infinite predates college, it seems
that I do not pay enough attention to them till now. But note that
even without mentioning this concept, the meaning of finite in the
definition of compact is still straightforward.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> For any positive integer n, let $J_{n}$ be the set
  whose elements are the integers $1, 2, \ldots, n$; let $J$ be the
  set consisting of all positive integers. For any set $A$, we say:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$A$ is finite if $A ~ J_{n}$ for some $n$ (the empty set is also
considered to be finite).</li>
  <li>$A$ is infinite if $A$ is not finite.</li>
  <li>$A$ is countable if $A ~ J$.</li>
  <li>$A$ is uncountable if $A$ is neither finite nor countable.</li>
  <li>$A$ is at most countable if $A$ is finite or countable.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above definition uses the notion of equivalence.</p>

<h3 id="equivalence">Equivalence</h3>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> If there exists a $1-1$ mapping of $A$ onto $B$, we say
  that $A$ and $B$ can be put in $1-1$ <em>correspondence</em>, or that $A$
  and $B$ have the same <em>cardinal number</em>, or briefly, that $A$ and
  $B$ are equivalent, and we write $A \sim B$.</p>

<h2 id="compact-explained">compact explained</h2>

<p>Now, let’s try to understand the idea of compact. First we see one set
that is not compact. Then we try to see the reason why compact is put
forward. The main intuition is, I think, which is not cited from
anywhere else, so it may be wrong, that the introduce of compact
bridges the gap between the set’s global properties and local
properties, infinite properties and finite properties.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>The open interval $I = (0, 1)$ is not compact.</p>

<p>To see why, let <script type="math/tex">G_{n} = (\frac{1}{n}, 2), n = 1, 2, 3 \ldots</script>. Each
<script type="math/tex">G_{n}</script> is an open cover of $I$ and as $n \rightarrow \infty$,
<script type="math/tex">G_{n}</script> could cover $I$. However, if we only take finite number of
subcover of <script type="math/tex">G_{n}</script>, we cannot cover $I$.</p>

<p>However, if we let $I$ to be a closed interval, say $I = [0, 1]$, it
is compact. A general theorem about this is described as every
k-cell(try Google what k-cell is if you have no idea what it is) is
compact. Proof here will be omitted(Proof can be found on Theorem 2.40
of Ref 1). The intuition behind the proof is that if an open cover $G$
could be found, then if any finite subcovers of $G$ cannot cover the
k-cell, you can always add more but finite number of subcovers to
cover all of $G$.</p>

<p>So why only a difference of open and closed makes such a difference?</p>

<p>In my view, the key difference is the limit point. If we do not makes
arbitrary statement about the limit point, which is the boundary in
this case, abnormal phenomenon could happen when approaching the limit
point. As in this case, when point, denoted $x$, is approaching zero,
if some function $f$ defined on the interval and $f$ has $x$ in the
denominator, $f$ may be boundless.</p>

<p>Thus, compact models the process that a point is approaching its limit
step by step(open ball by open ball) without making arbitrary
statement about the boundary. Consequently, compact has a number of
connection with continuity and convergence.</p>

<p>In the following, we would see more examples that compact is in action
to have a feeling about its effect.</p>

<p>Before that, let us introduce an important theorem that connect
finite with infinite.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> If <script type="math/tex">\{K_\alpha\}</script> is a collection of compact subsets of
  a metric space $X$ such that intersection of every finite
  subcollection of<script type="math/tex">\{K_\alpha\}</script> is nonempty, then <script type="math/tex">\cap
  K_{\alpha}</script> is nonempty.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> Fix a member <script type="math/tex">K_{1}</script> of <script type="math/tex">\{K_{\alpha}\}</script> and put
  <script type="math/tex">G_{\alpha} = K^{c}_{\alpha}</script>. Assume that no point of <script type="math/tex">K_{1}</script>
  belongs to every <script type="math/tex">K_{\alpha}</script>. Then the sets <script type="math/tex">G_{\alpha}</script> form an
  open cover of <script type="math/tex">K_{1}</script>; and since <script type="math/tex">K_{1}</script> is compact, there are
  finitely many indices <script type="math/tex">\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}</script> such that
  <script type="math/tex">K_{1} \subset G_{\alpha_{1}} \cup \ldots \cup G_{\alpha_{n}}</script>.
  But this means that <script type="math/tex">K_{1} \cap K_{\alpha_{1}} \cap \ldots \cap K_{\alpha_{n}}</script> is empty, in contradiction to our hypothesis.</p>

<p><strong>Corollary</strong> If <script type="math/tex">\{K_{n}\}</script> is a sequence of nonempty compact sets
  such that <script type="math/tex">K_{n} \supset K_{n + 1}, (n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots)</script>, then
  <script type="math/tex">\cap^{\infty}_{1} K_{n}</script> is not empty.</p>

<p>This corollary actually bridges finite and infinite together.</p>

<p>Now, let’s see the theorem in action.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> Let $P$ be a nonempty perfect set in $R^{k}$. Then $P$ is
  uncountable.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> Since $P$ has limits points, $P$ must be infinite. Suppose
  $P$ is countable, we denote the points of $P$ by <script type="math/tex">x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots</script> By analysis the interval between those points, we
  could find the contradiction we want.</p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">V_{1}</script> be the neighborhood of <script type="math/tex">x_{1}</script>. If <script type="math/tex">V_{1}</script>
  consists of all $y \in R^{k}$ such that <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
|y - x_{1}| < r %]]></script>, then the
  closure <script type="math/tex">\bar{V}_{1}</script> of <script type="math/tex">V_{1}</script> is the set of all $y \in R^{k}$
  such that <script type="math/tex">|y - x_{1}| \leq r</script>.</p>

<p>Suppose <script type="math/tex">V_{n}</script> has been constructed, so that <script type="math/tex">V_{n} \cap P</script> is
  not empty. Since every point of $P$ is a limit point of $P$, there
  is a neighborhood <script type="math/tex">V_{n+1}</script> such that 1. <script type="math/tex">\bar{V}_{n+1} \subset V_{n}</script>, 2. <script type="math/tex">x_{n} \notin V_{n+1}</script>, 3. <script type="math/tex">V_{n+1} \cap P</script> is not
  empty. The induction goes on.</p>

<p>Put <script type="math/tex">K_{n} = \bar{V}_{n} \cap P</script>. Since <script type="math/tex">\bar{V}_{n}</script> is closed
  and bounded, <script type="math/tex">\bar{V}_{n}</script> is compact(Theorem 2.41 Ref 1). Since
  <script type="math/tex">x_{n} \notin K_{n+1}</script>, not point of $P$ is in <script type="math/tex">\cap^{infty}_{1} K_{n}</script>. Since <script type="math/tex">K_{n} \subset P</script>, this implies that
  <script type="math/tex">\cap^{infty}_{1} K_{n}</script> is empty. But each <script type="math/tex">K_{n}</script> is nonempty,
  by 3, and <script type="math/tex">K_{n} \supset K_{n+1}</script> by 1, this contradicts the
  corollary above.</p>

<p>Proof is complete.</p>

<p>In this proof, the global property of the $P$ is proved by reducing
the contradiction into infinite intersection of small sets of
$P$. This shows some feelings about the bridge mentioned above.</p>

<h2 id="one-more-example">One More Example</h2>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> Compact subsets of metric spaces are closed.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> The proof also starts from the intuition that if the subset
  is open, we cannot approach the boundary of the subset, since they
  are not part of the set, in a finite step.</p>

<p>Before we prove the theorem, a common misunderstanding of the compact
should be pointed out. It is also straightforward to think that if one
set $G$ is compact, it could be covered by a finite subcover,
therefore, any subsets of $G$ could also be covered by such
subcover. Consequently, any subsets of $G$ is also compact.</p>

<p>The misunderstanding under this reasoning is that compact is defined
by all open covers, which means it has to rule out all possible open
covers. Note that the open covers of $G$ cannot cover all open covers
of its subsets. For example, a open cover could cover one subset
$G_i$ of $G$, which indeed is an open cover of $G_i$, but this open
cover is not one of $G$.</p>

<p>Now, the proof is begun(Ref 2).</p>

<p>We want to prove if $A \subseteq X$ is not closed, then $A$ is not
compact. We tackle the problem from the boundary. Since $A$ is not
closed, there is one point $p \in (cl, A) but \notin A$. For $n \in
N^{+}$, let</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">U_n = \{x \in X: d(x, p) > \frac{1}{n}\}</script>

<p>$U_n$ is a open cover of $A$, however, no finite subsets of $U_n$
would cover $A$.</p>

<h2 id="one-more-example-1">One More Example…</h2>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> Closed subsets of compact sets are compact.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> Ref 1. The intuition behind this proof is that for each
  finite open cover of $K$, there exists a finite subcover that could
  cover $F$, which means $F$ is compact.</p>

<p>Suppose $F \subset K \subset X$, $F$ is closed (relative to $X$), and
$K$ is compact. Let ${V_{\alpha}}$ be an open cover of $F$. If we
add one more open set $F^{c}$, then ${V_{\alpha}} \cup F^{c}$
becomes the open cover of $K$. Since $K$ is compact, there exists
finite subcovers that would cover $K$. By excluding $F^{c}$, those
subcovers are also a finite cover of $F$, which means $F$ is compact.</p>

<h2 id="one-more-examples">One More Examples</h2>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> Let (S, d) be a metric space. If <script type="math/tex">\{K_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}</script>
is a collection of compact sets such that the intersection of every
finite subcollection of <script type="math/tex">\{K_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}</script> is nonempty,
then <script type="math/tex">\cap_{\alpha \in A}K_{\alpha}</script> is nonempty.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong> Consider $K$, for any set in the collection <script type="math/tex">\{K_{\alpha}\}</script>
, we claim that there exists a $p \in K$ such that
<script type="math/tex">p \in K_{\alpha}, \forall \alpha \in A</script>. 
If not, we could prove contradiction.</p>

<p>Suppose not, $\forall p \in K$, there exists $\alpha$ that
<script type="math/tex">p \notin K_{\alpha}</script>. <script type="math/tex">\{K_{\alpha}^C\}</script> consists of an open cover of
$K$(since each <script type="math/tex">K_{\alpha}</script> is closed, thus their complement is
open). We know that $K$ is compact, there exists a finite sub covers
of <script type="math/tex">K_{\alpha}</script> covers $K$</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\{K_{\alpha_{i}}^{C}\}_{i=1,\ldots,n}</script>

<p>But this implies that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">K \subseteq K_{\alpha_{1}}^C \cup K_{\alpha_{2}}^C \cup \ldots \cup K_{\alpha_{n}}^C</script>

<p>Then 
<script type="math/tex">K \cap u_{\alpha_{1}}^C \cap K_{\alpha_{2}}^C \cap \ldots \cap K_{\alpha_{n}}^C = \emptyset</script>
.(If <script type="math/tex">x \in K_{\alpha_{j}}^C</script>, for some $j = 1,\ldots,n$. Then <script type="math/tex">x \notin K_{\alpha_{j}}^C</script>.
It follows that <script type="math/tex">x \notin K \cap u_{\alpha_{1}}^C \cap K_{\alpha_{2}}^C \cap \ldots \cap K_{\alpha_{n}}^C</script> and
<script type="math/tex">K \cap u_{\alpha_{1}}^C \cap K_{\alpha_{2}}^C \cap \ldots \cap K_{\alpha_{n}}^C = \emptyset</script>)
Since finite <script type="math/tex">K_{\alpha_{j}}^C, j=1,\ldots, n</script> will contain $K$, thus
containing <script type="math/tex">\{K_{\alpha}\}</script>. But for every finite subcollection of
<script type="math/tex">K_{\alpha}</script> their intersection should not be empty. This causes
contradiction.</p>

<p>Then there exists some $p$ such that <script type="math/tex">p \in \cap_{\alpha \in A}</script>, and
<script type="math/tex">\cap_{\alpha \in A} \neq \emptyset</script>.</p>

<p><em>Proof is finished. Ref 3</em></p>

<p>To see why compact is necessary, see this example below.</p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">I_n = (0, 1/n)</script>, each intersection between $I_m$ and $I_n$ is
not empty, however, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, the intersection is
empty.</p>

<p>This example shows that compact is mainly aims at the limit property
of set.</p>

<p>The intuition underlies this also related to the intuition put forward
at the first place. If we can guarantee one point in the set in the
finite case, we could also guarantee it in the infinite case. It
bridges the gap between finite and infinite.</p>
