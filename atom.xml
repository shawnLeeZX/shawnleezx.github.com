    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have spent the last two days trying to figure out what do use as a solid base
for further experiments on deep learning. I decided to settle down to Keras for
the time being. But given that it may not be the optimal choice, I want to note
down what I have tried so that it would be easier to pick up in the future.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>At first, our lab members are using Caffe, which I have spent some effort
learning it. However, as I got to know more in this field, combining with my
background in Computer Science, Caffe is not really the best platform to do
experiments, at least not for the people who want to understand and experiment
on all the details of various neural network elements and added another layer
of unnecessary engineering burden to the experiments.</p>

<p>Starting from the motivation to actually code NN from scratch, a language as
low level as C++ is not the right choice. Maybe at the time that I am really
equipped and really need large scale experiments, I will get back to Caffe.</p>

<p>Then I came to try Torch. At first I held high expectation given that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The easy binding between Lua and C.</li>
  <li>The API of torch is rather clean and most of the non-computational intensive
are actually written in Lua, which would save a ton of time.</li>
  <li>The <code>image</code> package of Torch is great given the experience to do
visualization under Python.</li>
  <li>Lua is not a barrier to me, given that I learn a new language rather fast.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then I spent some time to learn the code organization of Torch. Basically,
Torch is a combination of <a href="http://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a> with Lua packages and C
Libraries. It uses CMake to compile the project. So far so good.</p>

<p>But the real problem comes when I tried to find out a reasonable environment to
write Lua code. SURPRISINGLY, both Emacs and Vim does not have a work
environment for Lua. Emacs does not even have a usage syntax highlighting
for Lua. As for Vim, it does have a usage syntax highlighting, but it stops at
that. All other packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3169">luainspect.vim</a>:
Semantic highlighting for Lua in Vim</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4950">Lua Support 2</a> : Lua
IDE. Insert codesnippets, run, compile, and check the code and look up help.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3625">lua.vim</a> : Lua file
type plug-in for the Vim text editor</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3331">lua_omni</a> : omni
completion for Lua plus few extras</li>
</ul>

<p>are buggy in some extent and I really do not have time to fix them.</p>

<p>Then I tried to find some IDE recommended by the Torch documentation. There are
Eclipse with LDT, zbs-torch and some others, which all sucks. Maybe I have been
using Emacs and Vim for too long…</p>

<p>After about one day’s struggling with all different IDEs, I decided to try new
frameworks based on Theano, even they are all in their infancy.</p>

<p><a href="https://blocks.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Pylearn2</a> and
<a href="https://blocks.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Blocks &amp; Fuel</a> feels a bit
convoluted in design. Opendeep, Lasagne, Keras look alike. Given Keras offers
to enforce constraints on parameters, I decided to try Keras first.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- more -->

<p>近日闲暇时间重新看了看大约十年前的电视剧《仙剑奇侠传》，勾起了许许多多的回忆。在
缅怀的同时，也不由得思考起了许多问题。</p>

<p>从非正统的道家书籍——玄幻小说处得知过一句话：修炼有三个境界；一为看山是山，看水是
水；二为看山不是山，看水不是水；三为看山还是山，看水还是水。</p>

<p>自五年前大学入学开始，可以说是世界在我眼前开始展现其真实的面貌，我开始一点一点地
搭建自己的世界观、价值观、人生观。与此同时，当今社会各种各样丑陋的事情也我眼前一
一略过。人间失格，偌大的中国于我看来不过是一个崩坏的社会。从小看见的一个表象上合
理的世界逐渐崩坏，是以看山不是山，看水不是水。</p>

<p>自有彼领悟之后，我过得有些“世人皆醉吾独醒”的味道。</p>

<p>现代历史学对历史学家的定义是研究人类文明进程的学者，而不是将人类的历史视为一个循
环往复的无尽轮回。而历史进程的发展的源动力于我看来和马克思的观点相仿——底层基础决
定上层建筑。世界人口的增长导致的植物和猎物的不足促使人类由食物的采集者和狩猎者演
变成为农耕民族；对自然规律的发现引发的世界工业化和现代化降低了知识传播的成本，继
而开启民智，使得社会由集权统治、精英统治转变向民主社会。每一个社会的变化期总是会
导致人们思想的剧烈动荡，继而引起文化的变革。在这些社会变革的时期，普通人是最为迷
惘和痛苦的；而对于境界超越普通人的可能影响最后文化形成的社会精英来说，由于同类数
量的稀少，他们也是极为孤独的。这是民族或者种族进化时期个体所不可避免的阵痛。</p>

<p>但这个变革时期的哲学家们需要思考这个时代人们的生命的终极意义。我们究竟因何而来，
又将往何处而去？</p>

<p>在过往千年的人类文明中，哲学家们给出的答案大约可以归为两种：一个大众容易理解的答
案和一个大众不能理解的答案。前者告诉我们世界是有一个万能的神创造的，我们生命的所
有答案都可以由他那里得到解答。这种答案由于其亲和性往往在社会中处于统治地位；而后
者中的思考者希望寻求自己的答案，然而由于人类经验、观察、推理和知识积累的局限，导
致最终这类哲学家的答案往往是：生活是一个谜团，永远不要尝试去弄明白他。</p>

<p>对于第一种答案来说，西方社会中世纪千年的经验告诉我们这类“便宜”的信仰往往使人和社
会停滞不前，但是对于一个真正的答案的寻找需要同样昂贵的代价。自文艺复兴之后，西方
人便开始重新寻找终极问题的答案。十八世纪，黑格尔将人类文明的进化视为一个“世界精
神”的进化历程。但“世界精神”的进化需要的是一代代极度聪慧的人毕生对于自然、社会和
自身的思考：达尔文的《物种起源》；马克思的《资本论》；弗洛伊德的《精神分析》；赫
伯的《行为组织》（Organization of Behavior)；第谷穷其一生的观星；开普勒的三定律；
牛顿的万有引力定律；爱因斯坦的相对论。我想这个列表还可以排很长。</p>

<p>一代代人类最具天赋的人在去尝试去解决一个花费时长注定超越其生命历程的巨大问题的极
小部分。这种对于“我们因何而来？又讲往何处而去”的探寻若从参与其中的人最终能够走出
的步伐来看，不能不说是悲壮的史诗。但从另一个角度来想，这也是人类历史的上少有的机
遇，不足二百年以前绝大部分的智人都处在常年饥饿的状态中，穷其一生但求温饱，极少有
人能够有机会能够去思考这些最根本的问题。</p>

<p>这种思考是人类意识给予人最独特的天赋。在人们觉得有意义的事情大致可以分为三类：一
为独善其身；二为兼济天下；三即为那些仰望群星璀璨的夜空的时候，思考我们最初从哪里
来，又最终往何处去。第一类我们可以归其为生物自身的生存所带来的意义，第二类我们可
以归其为种族自身生存所带来的意义。这两类意义任何动物均具有，唯有第三类意义——对生
命与世界最终极的思考是唯有人类才能够尝试去探寻的。</p>

<p>回到之前所谓看山不是山，看水不是水的崩坏的现代中国。如今社会残酷的资本竞争和生存
压力使得人类从之前三类之中的天然有意义的生活转变到一种人造的虚幻的生活之中，纸醉
金迷、灯红酒绿，看似狂欢盛世，实际却是人人皆处于无边寂寞的精神孤岛之中。几乎所有
社会承认的名望、地位、财富都是虚幻，此所谓看山不是山，看水不是水。</p>

<p>但如克尔凯郭尔认为黑格尔的人类文明是“世界精神”的进化的理论里没有人类个体的角色，
继而缺乏对个人生说的指导一样，这样宏大的第三类意义也不能指导我们去过好我们的一生。
即使着世界再过于崩坏，我们还是不得不生存在其中。侠气地讲，有人的地方就有江湖。</p>

<p>所以当我问自己我能在第三条类路上走到何处时，我总是想起孔子的六个字“尽人事，知天
命”。</p>

<p>一年以前，在粗浅了解中国传统社会统一的价值文化——士文化和美国现代社会自由、民主、
平等、博爱、创新的价值文化之后，中国传统文化中的僵化礼制和祖先崇拜在我对中国传统
文化的认知中被视为非常邪恶，在这样于过去中不可自拔的文化注定在新世界里是没有位置
的。而对这种氏族组织的社会的彻底转变需要的是几代人上百年的逐渐演变，如中世纪西欧
社会所经历的千年中世纪。</p>

<p>但最近我逐渐发觉自由、创新这类现代公民的素质和对人生终极意义的寻找并不是同一个类
别的事物。西方社会纵然是一个“现代”社会，但其并没有对人生的应该如何度过有自己统一
的答案。如电影《少年时代》里描述的普通美国人的一生，我想他们社会的大众其实和我们
一样迷惘，一样不知所措。世界变化太快，人类对于自己和社会的认识永远处于一种滞后的
状态。但对于其中的最杰出者，其对于生命的领悟和中国古代圣人的领悟多少殊途同归——华
盛顿、查理芒格、乔布斯：华盛顿历任两任总统之后归隐田园类似道家道士修为初成下山历
练，功成之后回到山宗，归隐山野；《穷查理宝典》的作者给查理一生的总结即是：正心、
修身、齐家、致富、助天下，正是一个儒家士人最终极的理想；而乔布斯对于内心的追随正
应合了阳明心学与知行合一。而对于现代快节奏生活最有用的抗压技能反而是佛家的冥想。</p>

<p>然后我就想起了一百年前当时青年所讨论的西方社会什么该学，中华文化什么该留，古人的
思想虽然有其社会的局限，但其智慧却是超越时空的疆界的。如此，就到了最后那句话：看
山还是山，看水还是水。西方社会在寻找外在世界的答案的过程中远远超越了东方，但对于
内心世界答案的寻找大家都半斤八两。</p>

<p>理了这么长的思路，最终好像能再尝试总结一个暂时的答案。</p>

<p>道家在这个答案里占总纲地位。人生是一次修行，我们要经历独自的修行来获得我们的真元，
为儒家之正心、修身，亦为习得冥想和心学；小成之后需下山经滚滚红尘世界，历千百聚散
离合，走过儒家的齐家、治国、平天下的士人理想；大成之后归隐山林，小隐隐于野，大隐
隐于十，收徒著书，协助“世界精神”向前迈进一小步。</p>

<p>最终终得坐化，或者飞升。</p>

    <id>http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2015/07/14/how-to-add-text-to-scanned-pdf-without-text</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am reading some paper that is decades ago so no pdf file with text could
found, so I looked up to some solution. Here it is.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><a href="https://github.com/gkovacs/pdfocr">Pdfocr</a> is a ruby script that integrates
open source tools to add text layer to pdf files.</p>

<p>To be able to use it, there are some dependence needed, just as shell scripts.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">sudo apt-get install pdftk
</span><span class="line">sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng exactimage
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>You can infer what those programs are used for based what the author
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1456756">said</a> below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pdfocr was written by me (Geza Kovacs). It is simply a script which automates
the following process:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Splitting the PDF file into separate pages using pdftk</li>
    <li>Extracting out the image data using pdfimages</li>
    <li>Doing OCR (optical character recognition) using cuneiform</li>
    <li>Embedding the detected text back into the PDF file using hocr2pdf</li>
    <li>Merging together the files using pdftk.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, clone the ruby code.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">git clone https://github.com/gkovacs/pdfocr
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Then enjoy.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">pdfocr.rb -i foo.pdf -o out.pdf

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just tried to find a solution to zoom in and out in the GNOME desktop, so that
things could be seen better in case they are too small during presentation.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The solution a program called <code>mousewheelzoom</code>, whose source is held at github:
<a href="https://github.com/tobiasquinn/gnome-shell-mousewheel-zoom">gnome-shell-mousewheel-zoom</a>.</p>

<p>The installation instructions could be found there.</p>

<hr />

<p>Besides the solution that works, two solutions that did not work are also going
to noted below.</p>

<h3 id="compiz-setting">Compiz Setting</h3>

<p>At first I tried to changing setting in Compizconfig Settingsmanager, as
suggested in the
<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/82398/how-to-zoom-inzoom-out">link</a>. It turns
out that compiz is used by Unity, not GNOME. Since I have changed the desktop
environment, it does not obviously.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-native-solution">GNOME Native solution</h3>

<p>Then GNOME also offers such function directly in their <em>Universal Access</em>,
under <em>Seeing</em> tab, in category Zoom — just type Universal Access in the
Dock. However, it does not work either.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All those years of studying philosophy, religion, science, history and all the
experience that I will not try to list here, it leads me to think that
consciousness is an emergent phenomenon. I just asked myself, if human beings
are designed, and within current framework of Artificial Intelligence Research,
the source power of consciousness is the optimization of certain functions.</p>

<p>Inspired by the Three Laws of Robots, three optimization functions for human
race came into my mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A human must ensure its own gene and spirit ‘s survival on the first
priority.</li>
  <li>A human must ensure its own race’s survival on the first priority given the
rules listed numerically above are obeyed.</li>
  <li>A human must pursue the intellectual understanding of the universe on the
first priority given the rules listed numerically above are obeyed.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I will revise it when I have some other ideas.</p>

<p>For those who want to consider it seriously, don’t.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Thought Provoking Story</p>

<p>This Too Shall Pass – Understand This Deeply</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Once A King Called Upon All Of His Wise Men And Asked Them, ” Is There A Mantra
Or Suggestion Which Works In Every Situation, In Every Circumstances, In Every
Place And In Every Time. In Every Joy, Every Sorrow, Every Defeat And Every
Victory? One Answer For All Questions? Something Which Can Help Me When None Of
You Is Available To Advise Me? Tell Me Is There Any Mantra?”</p>

<p>All The Wise Men Were Puzzled By The King’s Question. They Thought And
Thought. After A Lengthy Discussion, An Old Man Suggested Something Which
Appealed To All Of Them. They Went To The King And Gave Him Something Written
On Paper, With A Condition That The King Was Not To See It Out Of Curiosity.</p>

<p>Only In Extreme Danger, When The King Finds Himself Alone And There Seems To Be
No Way, Only Then He Can See It. The King Put The Papers Under His Diamond
Ring.</p>

<p>Some Time Later, The Neighbors Attacked The Kingdom. King And His Army Fought
Bravely But Lost The Battle. The King Had To Flee On His Horse. The Enemies
Were Following Him. Getting Closer And Closer. Suddenly The King Found Himself
Standing At The End Of The Road - That Road Was Not Going Anywhere. Underneath
There Was A Rocky Valley Thousand Feet Deep. If He Jumped Into It, He Would Be
Finished…And He Could Not Return Because It Was A Small Road…The Sound Of
Enemy’s Horses Was Approaching Fast. The King Became Restless. There Seemed To
Be No Way.</p>

<p>Then Suddenly He Saw The Diamond In His Ring Shining In The Sun, And He
Remembered The Message Hidden In The Ring. He Opened The Diamond And Read The
Message. The Message Was – “ THIS TOO SHALL PASS ”</p>

<p>The King Read It . Again Read It. Suddenly Something Struck Him- Yes ! This Too
Will Pass. Only A Few Days Ago, I Was Enjoying My Kingdom. I Was The Mightiest
Of All The Kings. Yet Today, The Kingdom And All My Pleasures Have Gone. I Am
Here Trying To Escape From Enemies. Like Those Days Of Luxuries Have Gone, This
Day Of Danger Too Will Pass. A Calm Came On His Face. He Kept Standing
There. The Place Where He Was Standing Was Full Of Natural Beauty. He Had Never
Known That Such A Beautiful Place Was Also A Part Of His Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Revelation Of The Message Had A Great Effect On Him. He Relaxed And Forgot
About Those Following Him. After A Few Minutes He Realized That The Noise Of
The Horses And The Enemy Coming Was Receding. They Moved Into Some Other Part
Of The Mountains And Were Nowhere Near Him.</p>

<p>The King Was Very Brave. He Reorganized His Army And Fought Again. He Defeated
The Enemy And Regained His Empire. When He Returned To His Empire After
Victory, He Was Received With Much Fanfare. The Whole Capital Was Rejoicing In
The Victory.</p>

<p>Everyone Was In A Festive Mood. Flowers Were Being Showered On King From Every
House, From Every Corner. People Were Dancing And Singing. For A Moment King
Said To Himself, “ I Am One Of The Bravest And Greatest King. It Is Not Easy To
Defeat Me. With All The Reception And Celebration He Saw An Ego Emerging In
Him. ”</p>

<p>Suddenly The Diamond Of His Ring Flashed In The Sunlight And Reminded Him Of
The Message. He Open It And Read It Again: “ THIS TOO SHALL PASS ”.</p>

<p>He Became Silent. His Face Went Through A Total Change - From The Egoist He
Moved To A State Of Utter Humbleness. If This Too Is Going To Pass, It Is Not
Yours. The Defeat Was Not Yours, The Victory Is Not Yours. You Are Just A
Watcher. Everything Passes By. We Are Witnesses Of All This. We Are The
Perceivers. Life Comes And Goes. Happiness Comes And Goes. Sorrow Comes And
Goes.</p>

<p>Now As You Have Read This Story, Just Sit Silently And Evaluate Your Own
Life. This Too Will Pass. Think Of The Moments Of Joy And Victory In Your
Life. Think Of The Moment Of Sorrow And Defeat. Are They Permanent ? They All
Come And Pass Away.</p>

<p>Life Just Passes Away. There Is Nothing Permanent In This World. Every Thing
Changes Except The Law Of Change. Think Over It From Your Own Perspective. You
Have Seen All The Changes. You Have Survived All Setbacks, All Defeats And All
Sorrows. All Have Passed Away. The Problems In The Present, They Too Will Pass
Away. Because Nothing Remains Forever. Joy And Sorrow Are The Two Faces Of The
Same Coin. They Both Will Pass Away.</p>

<p>You Are Just A Witness Of Change. Experience It, Understand It, And Enjoy The
Present Moment - This Too Shall Pass</p>

    <link href="http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2015/06/05/connection-between-pca/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-05T21:10:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2015/06/05/connection-between-pca</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- more -->

<p>When we are running PCA on images, the first principle component we get is
normally looks like the DC term, which is the first Fourier bases of
images. After some analysis, I found that this makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>We could unify PCA and Fourier Transform from filter bank or linear operator
point of view. Actually those two point of views are just different way to say
the same thing in signal processing and mathematics.</p>

<p>From filter bank point of view, the process of getting the PCA coefficients and
Fourier coefficients could be regarded as passing the original signal to a
Linear Time Invariant system. Each Fourier basis or eigenvector is a
filter. All of them make up the filter bank.</p>

<p>From linear operator point of view, such process could be taken as an operator
to project the point in one space to another space.</p>

<p>It turns out that Fourier basis $e^{i\omega t}$ and eigenvector $v$ of covariance
matrix are both eigenvector(this eigenvector is not specific to the eigenvector
computed from covariance matrix of the data) of the LTI system.</p>

<p>The Fourier basis eigenvectors could be taken as the eigenvector of covariance
of all possible images that could be formed by spatial complex exponential
signal. So it is fixed. As for the data driven eigenvector $v$, it is only the
eigenvector of that amount of data. They are both orthogonal with other
eigenvectors within their sets. If data driven eigenvector get normalized, it
has unit norm as well.</p>

<p>This could explain why the first principal components of covariance looks a lot
similar do the first Fourier basis. Because DC term of images affect all
pixels, naming all dimensions. So its variance is the largest, which makes it
similar with first fourier basis. I think similar argument could be made to
other principal components and Fourier bases as well. But they may be less
obvious then the first one.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<!-- more -->

<p>It is a bit hard to internalize the fact that the composition of finite
dimensional linear transformation is the multiplication of the matrices
representing them. I figured out a concept explanation.</p>

<p>Denoting the first transformation matrix as $A$ and the second as $B$,
$\vec{a_{i}}$ as the row of $A$ and $\vec{b_{j}}$ as the row of $B$, the to
be transformed vector as $x$, basically, each $\vec{a}_{i}$ determines how
each coordinate $x_{i}$ of $\vec{x}$ will contribute to the result
coordinates.</p>

<p>Then if you do another linear transform on $\vec{Ax}$, each $\vec{b}_{j}$ determines how
each coordinate of $\vec{Ax}$ will contribute to the final vector. Since the transform is
linear, we could first consider how $\vec{a_{i}}$ contributes to the final
vector, its final result with $x$ is just a multiple of $x_{i}$. Each
component of $\vec{a_{i}}$ actually could be taken as a to be transformed
vector of $B$. Each row of $AB$ could be viewed in the following way.</p>

<p>$\vec{a_{i}}$ is the new coordinate of standard basis $\vec{e_{i}}$ after
applying $A$. Starting from there, the second new coordinates of those first
new coordinates are obtained by applying $B$. So if we apply $AB$ on standard
basis $\vec{e_{i}}$, the result is going to be the second new
coordinates. Actually, such coordinates are:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\sum\vec{b_{j}}(\vec{a_{i}})_{j}
</script>

<p>which is just $\vec{(AB)_{i}}$.</p>

    <updated>2015-05-14T11:14:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2015/05/14/what-mathematical-object-random-really-is</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An example will be noted here to illustrate what a random variable really is.</p>

<p>Sadly, things will be clearer with graph but for now I do not have a solution
to make good illustration really quickly enough — normally I write a post in
about half an hour.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The problem setting is that if we toss a coin twice, there are four possible
outcomes that we could get — $(hh, ht, th, tt)$, where $h$ stands for head
while $t$ stands for tail. If we denote the results as tuples, we could
represent the experiment results as $((1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0))$. If we
take each element of the tuple with two elements as dimension of a vector
space, each tuple could be regarded as an element in a vector space. we could
represent our experiment result in a 2D plane.</p>

<p>Consider that a random variable $X$ which is used to denote the number of heads
in this experiment. Its value would be 0, 1 or 2.</p>

<p>Now we make the statement that random variable a mapping, which maps the
original event space $\Omega$(the four tuples here) to a subset$T’$(a set of
${0, 1, 2}$ here) of a set $T$(the positive integer set $N^{+}$). Let’s see
what this actually means.</p>

<p>In the first level, the understanding could be pretty straight forward. $X$
in some sense agglomerate the event space in the most preliminary level – the
atomic exclusive level to a coarser level — the number of heads. So $(1, 0)$
and $(0, 1)$ all collapse to the point ${1}$ in the set $T$. Correspondingly,
the probability measure assigned on each event is changed. Mathematically,
given a set $A$ in $T$, its probability now is </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
P^{X}(A) = P(\{\omega: X(\omega) \in A \}) = P(X^{-1}(A)) = P(X \in A)
</script>

<p>However, there is a way to think in the framework of functional analysis. Each
mapping, precisely, function, in a vector space(Hilbert space could be a
properer setting) could be regarded as projecting points in the vector space to
the basis determined by the adjoint operator of this function.</p>

<p>In previous example, a two dimensional space is reduced into one dimensional
space, whose basis is the adjoint operator of the function $X$. And the
probability measure of a point in this new one dimensional space is the sum of
all points in the two dimensional points that will be projected at that
point. Now, let’s see what those statements mean.</p>

<p>If we draw a line crossing origin with slope one, all points with the same
number of heads will be projected at the same point in this line. The point
with two heads, which is $(1, 1)$, will be projected at point $(1, 1)$. The
points with one head, which is $(1, 0) and (0, 1)$, will be projected at
$(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$. Finally, the point with no head
will be projected at $(0, 0)$. Now we drop the second dimension, each point in
this line will semantically mean the number of heads, where the random variable
will vary. Their probability measure will be summed while points are being
projecting.</p>

<p>The counting of heads is also represented by the function $(x + y)$(the value
in each dimension of previous two dimensional space actually means the number
of heads, so their sum will the number of heads), which is the adjoint operator
of basis $(1, 1)$. This form is the representation of the basis of our new
space in our old two dimensional space.</p>

<p>One last note. When we are reducing dimensionality, we are also discarding the
information of how many number of tail we get.</p>

<p>In conclusion, what random variable really is?</p>

<p>Random variable first maps original event space onto another event space, then
defines a new probability distribution on the new space according its relation
to the old event space. The intuitive meaning of the random variable is how it
deals with original event space, which is counting the number of heads
here. But essentially, it defines a distribution or in other words, probability
measure at each point(the number of heads), in the new space.</p>

<h2 id="wavelet">Wavelet</h2>

<h3 id="transition-from-fourier-to-wavelet">Transition from Fourier to Wavelet</h3>

<p>The learning of one dimensional Fourier transform part of Fourier transform is
finished. The key of transition from Fourier analysis to wavelet analysis in
transient signal analysis is learned, which will be described in the following:</p>

<p>Fourier transform is actually a scan over all frequency spectrum on the
signal. For a time-limited signal, or mathematically non-periodic signal, the
value of the signal outside the time-limited interval is zero not because it is
indeed zero in nature but we do not care about its value. So if we use all
spectrum of Fourier transform to get its new representation in frequency
domain, the coefficients whose period are far longer than the time span or far
shorter than the time span will be highly inaccurate — only when the integral
or inner product is taken a integer multiplication of period length, the
coefficients we get is accurate. So in windowed Fourier transform, the
frequency whose period is far longer than the window is synthesized using
different time notes of the signal while the one whose period is far shorter
than the window is synthesized by different high frequency in the same time
note.</p>

<p>Discrete Fourier transform is an approximate of continuous Fourier transform,
which is directly called Fourier transform in previous paragraph. The
approximate is made actual taking the time span of the time-limited signal as
such signal’s period. Similar approximation is also made in the frequency
domain. So we get a periodic frequency span. This is why we have to ensure the
sampling rate is high enough to guarantee that after the periodization of
frequency part, different periods do not overlap with each other.</p>

<p>So to overcome this problem is the key reason to introduce wavelet analysis,
whose bases’ time span are dynamically determined to suit the corresponding
frequency they want to decouple, or in another word, to detect.</p>

<h3 id="goals-next-step">Goals Next Step</h3>

<p>How exactly this idea is implemented thirty years ago should be further
investigated <strong>on the purpose of this research goal</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How could Fourier and wavelet analysis bridges the gap between the physical
entity and things that may have semantic meaning?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the sensors of human beings are receiving are actually just physical
signals — the different strength of illumination of light, different
amplitude and frequency of air vibration. The problem solved by scientists in
18th and 19th are most linear problem that deals with the nature instead of how
human deals with nature. The light and air pressure vibration are both
superposition of various basic building blocks of nature’s atom —
electromagnet wave and mechanical vibration wave. Frequency, amplitude and
phase of them are the first layer nature of them. For human beings, the learned
nature of them is actually detecting patterns. The gap between those two would
be very important to understand the perception problem of human race.</p>

<p>To address this gap, wavelet analysis and its high dimensional form could be a
promising direction. To know exactly where this direction could lead, the
following questions and guess should be addressed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wavelet that does not use complex exponential directly may be understood as
a layer that stacked on the complex exponential, which is the frequency
nature of the signal – the atom of signal. This may be the reason why
theorem proving of wavelet I have encountered now all depends on Fourier
transform.</li>
  <li>How different kinds of wavelets are designed? One key here is that we want
the optimal time and frequency localization for one particular wavelet
basis. But there must be more in this. Some work have mentioned the
vanishing moment of wavelet. Those design may bring to some very deep
physics facts that is very illuminating.</li>
  <li>One dimensional analysis is actually the special case of higher dimensional
analysis. Everything is a vector in the real world. After getting
familiarity with one dimensional theory, the leap from one dimensional to
higher dimensional could lead to the direct intuition to the real world and
the solving of problem that involving the basic properties of higher
dimensional space, such as 2D and 3D rotation, scaling of signals.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="execution-plan">Execution Plan</h3>

<p>Fortunately, the survey about which books to read has just been made.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Insight Into Wavelets, from Theory to Practice</em> is relatively detailed
enough and contains pertinent amount of practice. It seems to cover relevant
Math, such as function space, nested space, enough intuition and historical
development, the design of wavelet and enough examples. This book may be the
main thread to follow when I back to learn it again.</li>
  <li><em>Ten lectures on wavelets</em> is another candidate main thread to follow. Its
level of detail and conversation style will be further checked when I back to
learn it again.</li>
  <li><em>A Friendly Guide to Wavelets</em> should be used in complement with the first
book. This book is too contingent with examples and proof detail, but its
explanation on intuition is good.</li>
  <li><em>A First Course in Wavelets with Fourier Analysis</em> has not been investigated
much. Its try to deal with Fourier and wavelet at the time could make it
miserable, but referring to it from time to time may be helpful to see their
connection after having learned Fourier and wavelet enough.</li>
  <li><em>The World According to Wavelets The Story of a Mathematical Technique in the
Making</em> is all about history and intuition. The second half that deals with
math has not been read yet. After having learned wavelet, this small book
could be helpful on wavelet’s connection with other discipline and historical
development.</li>
  <li><em>A wavelet tour of signal processing</em> is a reference book. It deals with the
big perspective on the transition from wavelet method to dictionary
learning. This is the book to read after I have learned wavelet well.</li>
  <li><em>Conceptual Wavelets in Digital Signal Processing</em>, <em>A primer on wavelets and
their scientific applications</em>, <em>Ripples In Mathematics</em> and <em>The Illustrated
Wavelet Transform Handbook</em> are more about mechanics of wavelet. Those
mechanics could be helpful after the overall picture of wavelet is gotten.</li>
  <li><em>Wavelets and Subband Coding</em>, <em>Multirate Systems And Filter Banks</em> and
<em>Wavelets and Filter Banks</em> are about more the discrete version of
*wavelet. Those will be helpful when I am working on implementation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bayesian-statistics">Bayesian Statistics</h2>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>There has been twenty years of work on computer vision and machine learning
using Bayesian methods. The initial taking off initialized by Hinton also
origins from statistical method — Deep Belief Net. There are several reasons
to understand Bayesian related methods:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To acquire the ability to understand previous important work and work on
deep learning involving Bayesian methods.</li>
  <li>Statistics is important for biologically inspired work. Neurons in brain
never get activated alone. It is their statistics pattern that matters.</li>
  <li>It is another way to think about problem. If we view the branch of applied
mathematics as modeling the world from a low level, relatively deterministic
perspective, probability viewed it from a high level, semantic way. It is
important to have probability to deal with high level part of deep learning
system.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="goal-next-step">Goal Next Step</h3>

<p>The first step goal is to understand the fundamental intuition behind
probability and statistics, just like understanding the construction of number
system while studying functional analysis, then how exactly Bayesian methods
depart from traditional frequentism. Computational perspective of Bayesian
method such as sampling could wait.</p>

<h3 id="execution-plan-1">Execution Plan</h3>

<p>The main plan to follow is the thread on Bayesian statistics on
Metaacademy. Books are also important for reference and systemtization of
learning.</p>

<h4 id="basic-probability-and-statistics">Basic Probability and Statistics</h4>
<ul>
  <li><em>An Introduction To Probability Theory And Its Applications</em> is the classic
book on probability. It gets the intuition and motivation right. If knowledge
which needs deeper learning arises, this is the book to consult.</li>
  <li><em>Probability Jim Pitman</em> is an undergraduate textbook on probability.</li>
  <li><em>Statistical Inference</em> is the book to read after having a good understanding
of probability.</li>
  <li><em>Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis</em> is a good reference for
statistics. It is relatively simpler than <em>Statistical Inference</em>, which it a
good fallback candidate if I have a hard time understanding the book.</li>
  <li><em>Bayesian Data Analysis</em> After the basic foundation of probability and
statistics is laid. This is the book to read to know Bayesian methods.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="multivariate-statistics">Multivariate statistics</h4>
<ul>
  <li><em>Modern Multivariate Statistical Techniques</em> and <em>An Introduction to
Multivariate Statistical Analysis</em> is the book to consult when jumping into
real world data.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="modern-probability-theory">Modern Probability Theory</h4>
<ul>
  <li><em>Probability and Random Processes Grimmett</em> tries to cover stuffs that needs
measure theory in using language that without measure theory. It could be a
bridge to the gap of modern probability and classic probability.</li>
  <li><em>Probability Essentials</em> describes the thread of modern probability tersely.</li>
  <li><em>Probability, Theory and Examples</em> is like Mallat’s wavelet tour. It is a
book to read after you have relative good understanding of modern probability
theory. It could offer you a bigger picture.</li>
  <li><em>Foundation of Modern Probability</em> is the most advanced book which may only
be needed by PhD in probability.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="real-analysis">Real Analysis</h4>
<ul>
  <li><em>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</em> is the book to consult in undergraduate
level.</li>
  <li><em>James Munkres Topology</em> is the book to consult about topology.</li>
  <li><em>Folland. Real Analysis Modern Techniques and their Application</em> is the book
to learn real analysis seriously.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="link-between-communities">Link Between Communities</h2>

<p>A major breakthrough could be made is that the work on sparse and redundant
dictionary learning in signal processing community, traditional Bayesian
statistics machine learning community, neuroscience community and the community
working on experimental deep learning could be linked together.</p>

<p>What CNN tries to learn is basically a sparse and redundant dictionary that is
used to capture semantic patterns of sensed signal. Signal processing community
could offer theoretical guidance. Neurosciece could offer biological
experimental facts and deep learning community could offer simulation
experiments facts and lastly, Bayesian statistics community could offer ways to
deal with the high level relationship between atom in the dictionary.</p>

<h2 id="ending">Ending</h2>

<p>I think this is all of it. Hope I will be back soon.</p>

<h2 id="excerpt">Excerpt</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Each age writes its own history. Not because the earlier history is
wrong, but because each age faces new problems, ask new questions,
and seeks new answers. This precept is self-evident today when the
tempo of change is increasing exponentially, creating a
correspondingly urgent need for new history posing new questions
and offering new answers. – Page xxv</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“For the first time in the course of history,” concludes physicist
Werner Heisenberg, “man on earth faces only himself; he finds no
longer any other partner or foe.” The great irony of our era is
that this primacy is a root cause of our current global malaise and
apprehension. Having eliminated all possible rivals, we humans on
longer confront any foes. We confront only ourselves.<br />
This new confrontation with our inner self rather than with the
outside world is a formidable undertaking. It requires not merely
the acquisition of more knowledge and technology, an enterprise in
which we have proven unequaled. It requires also the crowning of
that knowledge with an ethical compass to provide it with direction
and purpose. In the seventeenth century, when the scientific
revolution was emerging, the English philosopher Francis Bacon
noted its potentiality and warned against its perils. He
enthusiastically endorsed the pursuit of “knowledge and skill”
through science, but he added that the pursuit should be conducted
with “humility and charity,” and not “for the please of mind, or
for contention, or for superiority to others, or for profit or
fame, or power, or any of these inferior things; but for the
benefit and use of life.”<br />
– Page xxvii</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Responsibility lies with the institutions of society, not in the
virtues of the individual.<br />
– Page xxvii, Oceanographer Jacques Cousteau</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anthropology holds up a great mirror to man and lets him look at
himself in his infinite variety. – Clyde Kluckhohn, Page 3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, our problem as a species is to balance our ever-expanding
knowledge with wisdom in how we use that knowledge. We shall see in
the following chapters that learning how to balance knowledge and
wisdom is becoming so urgent that , as Einstein has warned us, our
future as a species depends on the outcome. – Page 6</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important lesson that history teaches us is that such wars are
not inevitable. They have occurred not because of human nature but
because of human societies. And human societies have been made by
human beings and can be remade by human beings. This is the gist of
the following conclusion by anthropologist Ashley Montagu
concerning human nature: “Certainly we born with genetically based
capacities for many kinds of behavior, but the manner in which
these capacities become abilities depends upon the training they
receive, upon learning … Our true inheritance lies in our ability
  to make and shape ourselves, not the creatures but the creators of
destiny.” – Page 39</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen the metal-worker at his task at the mouth of his
furnace, with fingers like a crocodile’s. He stank worse than
fish-spawn…. The stonemason finds his work in every kind of hard
stone. When he has finished his labors his arms are worn out, and
he sleeps all doubled up until sunrise, His knees and spine are
broken…. The barber shaves from morning till night; he never sits
down except to meals. He hurries from house to house looking for
business. He wears out his arms to fill his stomach, like bees
eating their own honey…. The farmer wars the same clothes for all
times. His voice is as raucous as a crow’s. His fingers are always
busy, his arms are dried up by the wind. He takes his rest – when
he does get any rest – in the mud. If he’s in good health he
shares good health with the beasts if he is ill his bed is the bare
earth in the middle if his beasts….<br />
Apply your heart to learning. In truth there is nothing that can
compare with it. I f you have profited by a single day at school
it is a gain for eternity. – Page 49</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the origins of writing are to be found in the new
circumstances arising from the production of economic surplus, it
has other far-reaching and fateful effects. It stimulated
intellectual development because factual data could now be
collected, recorded, and passed along to successive
generations. Equally significant, writing helped to define and
consolidate individual cultures. It gave permanent written form to
religious traditions, which thereby became sacred books; to social
customs, which became law codes; and to oral myths and stories,
which became classics. Thus writing became the chief means for the
cultural integration of the civilizations of mankind. – Page 53</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the core f Buddhism are four great truths: (1) Life is sorrow;
(2) the cause of sorrow is desire; (3) escape is possible only by
stopping desire; and (4) the cessation of desire can only be
achieved by the “eight-fold” path which is comprised of right
belief, right ambition, right speech, right conduct, right living ,
right effort , right thoughts, and right pleasures. The objective
of all this effort is Nirvana, literally meaning “emptiness,” the
“blowing out of the flame.” – Page 84</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the
institutions of others. We do not copy our neighbors, but are an
example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for
the administration is in the hands of the many and not the
few. But while the law secures equal justice to all alike in their
private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognized, and
when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the
public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of
merit. Neither is poverty a bar, but a man may benefits his
country whatever be the obscurity of his condition. There is no
exclusiveness in our public life, and in our private intercourse
we are not suspicious of one another, nor angry with our neighbor
if he does what he likes…. We are lovers of the beautiful, yet
simple in our tastes, and we cultivate the mind without loss of
manliness. Wealth we employ, not for talk and ostentation, but
when there is a real use for it. To avow poverty with us is no
disgrace; the true disgrace is in doing nothing to avoid it. n
Athenian citizen does not neglect the state because he takes care
of his own household; and even those of us who are engaged in
business have a very fair idea of politics. We alone regard a man
who takes no interest in public affairs, not as a harmless, but as
a useless character; and if few of us are originator, we are all
sound judges of policy. The great impediment to action is , in our
opinion, not discussion, but the want of that knowledge which is
gained by discussion preparatory to action. For we have a peculiar
power of thinking before we at and of acting too….<br />
To sum up: I say that Athens is the school of Hellas….<br />
I have paid the required tribute, in obedience to the law, making
use of such fitting words as I had. The tribute of deeds has been
paid in part; for the dead have been honorably interred, and it
remains only that their children should be maintained at the
public charge until they are grown up: this is the solid prize
with which, as with garland, Athens crowns her sons living and
dead, after a struggle like theirs. – Pericles’s funeral oration
Page 93</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most successful of the new religious was Christianity. It
offered the doctrine of one God, the Father Omnipotent, in place
of the polytheism of the Greco-Roman gods and the monotheism of
the oriental cult. It brought the solace of a Redeemer, Jesus, who
was not an ambiguous figure in a mythological labyrinth but who
miraculously lived an earthly life, even though he was the Son of
God. “I bring you tidings of great joy which shall be to all
people.” Christianity also guaranteed salvation to the believer,
but instead of a starry eternity, it restored him to life through
a personal resurrection foreshadowed by the Resurrection of Christ
himself. Perhaps most important of all, Christianity provided
fellowship when times were disjointed and common people felt
uprooted and forsaken. All Christians were brothers, and their
meetings were often called agape, meaning “love” in Greek. They
assisted one another, and by their devotion and self-denial they
set an aspiring and contagious example. Thus at a time when the
laws and philosophy of the old order were becoming irrelevant and
inviable, Christianity offered relevance and hope for the meek and
the humble. – Page 112-113</p>

  <li>
    <p>Today we have that knowledge, and therefore we have the potential
to free ourselves from millennia-old scourges. It is tragic that
the potential has not yet been realized, but the fact remains that
it does exist. And it exists because of the advances made possible
in the past by the different civilizations of the human
race. Therefore, to answer the question, has civilization been a
curse or a blessing? – in the past it has been both. What it will
be in the future depends on whether the knowledge accumulated from
past civilizations is used for destructive or constructive
purposes. – Page 161</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The millennium between the sixth century, when the Sui dynasty
restored imperial unity, and the sixteenth, when the Westerners
began their intrusion by sea, was for China an era of unparalleled
political, social, and cultural stability. But this stability
paradoxically proved to be a curse as well as a blessing. It was a
blessing because Chinese society during this millennium provided
more material advantages and more psychological security for more
people than any other society in the world. But the stability was
also a curse because China was so successful and comfortable that
it remained relatively unchanged, though not completely static. At
the same time, however, as we shall see in the following chapter,
the West was being transformed by its technological achievements,
its economic vitality, and its social and political pluralism. All
this engendered a dynamism that culminated in the West’s
domination of the entire globe. The end result, then, was the
disruption of the beautifully balanced but conservative Chinese
society by the irresistible expansionism of the West. – Page 211</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The renaissance of Confucian thought took place mostly during the
time of troubles following the collapse of the T’ang dynasty, when
the needs of the age clearly called for something more than the
mere memorization of Confucian classics. Accordingly, a number of
scholars undertook a searching reappraisal of the problems of
humankind and of the universe.<br />
A leader in this undertaking was Chu Hsi(1129-1200), who in his
youth had studies both Buddhism and Taoism. Satisfied with
neither, he turned to the Confucian classics, and with his
remarkable talent for synthesis he worked out an interpretation
that combined elements of Buddhism and Taoism with Confucianism
and that was more satisfying and relevant for his time. His
approach – essentially that of the empirical rationalist –
taught that the universe is governed by natural law, which should
be understood and respected. He also believed in the goodness of
people and in their ability to become more perfect. He compared
the individual to a mirror covered with dust, which if cleaned
will be as bright as ever. Evil, therefore, was the result of
neglect and of defective education, and hence could be corrected.<br />
Chu Hsi’s influence in the Confucian world was comparable to that
of Thomas Aquinas in Western Christendom. – Page 219 - 220</p>

    <p>“We should note the force, effort, and consequences of inventions
which are nowhere more conspicuous than in those three which were
unknown to the ancients, namely, printing, gunpowder, and the
compass. For these three have changed the appearance and state of
the whole world.” This statement by the British
philosopher-scientist Francis Bacon (1561-1626) is especially
significant because all three of the inventions that he so wisely
selected originated from China. Yet they had little effect on that
country in comparison with their explosive repercussions in the
West. Chinese civilization was too deeply rooted and Chinese
imperial organization too all-embracing to allow such inventions
to disrupt traditional institutions and practices. Thus printing
was used to disseminate old ideas rather than new; gunpowder
reinforced the position of the emperor  rather than of emerging
national monarchs; and the compass, despite the remarkable
expeditions of Cheng Ho, was not used for  world trade and
exploration and empire building as in the West.<br />
The root of this fateful difference is to be found in the unique
characteristics of the new Western civilization – pluralistic,
adaptable, and free of the shackles of tradition that bound all
the other Eurasian civilizations. The new civilization brought
about historic change not only for the West but also, as Bacon
foresaw, for the entire globe as it came under the influence of
the revolutionary new society. – Page 228</p>

    <p>The history of mankind proves that advances of culture depend upon
the opportunities presented to a social group to learn from the
experience of their neighbors. The discoveries of the group spread
to others and, the more varied the contacts, the greater the
opportunities to learn. The tribes of simplest culture are on the
whole those that have been isolated for very long periods and
hence could not profit from the cultural achievements of their
neighbors.<br />
In other words, the key to different levels of human development
has been accessibility. Those with the most opportunity to
interact with other people have been the most likely to forge
ahead. Indeed, they were driven to do so, for there was selective
pressure as well as opportunity. Accessibility involved the
constant threat of assimilation or elimination if opportunity was
not grasped. By contrast, those who were isolated received neither
stimulus nor threat, were free from selective pressure and thus
could remain relatively unchanged through the millennia without
jeopardizing their existence.<br />
If this hypothesis is applied on a global scale, the remote Australian
aborigines should have been the most culturally retarded of all major
groups; next, the American Indians in the New World; then the Negroes of
sub-Saharan Africa; and finally – the least retarded, or the most
advanced – the various peoples of Eurasia, who were in constant and
generally increasing contact with each other. This, of course, is precisely
the gradation of culture levels found by the European discoverers
after 1500. The Australian aborigines were still at the Paleolithic
food-gathering stage; the American Indians varied from the Paleolithic
tribes of California to the impressive civilizations of Mexico, Central
America, and Peru; the African Negroes presented comparable diversity,
though their overall level of development was higher; and finally, at quite
another level, there were the highly advanced and sophisticated
civilizations found Eurasia – the Moslem in the Middle East, the Hindu in
south Asia, and the Confucian in east Asia.

    <p>At its height, the Ottoman Empire was indeed a great imperial
structure. Its heartland was Turkish Asia Minor, but the majority of the
population consisted of Moslem Arabs to the south and Balkan Christians to
the west. The empire sprawled over three continents and comprised some 50
million people, compared to the 5 million of contemporary English. Little
wonder that Christians of the time looked on the ever-expanding Ottoman
Empire with awe and described it as “a daily increasing flame, catching
hold of whatsoever comes next, still to proceed further.”<br />

    <p>General knowledge is, from these causes, little if at all cultivated; every
man is supposed to know his own business or profession, with which it is
esteemed foolish and improper for any other person to interfere. The man of
general science, a character so frequent and so useful in Christian Europe,
is unknown; and nay one, but a mere artificer, who should concern himself
with the founding of cannon, the building of ships, or the like, would be
esteemed little better than a madman. The natural consequence of these
narrow views is, that the professors of any art of science are themselves
profoundly ignorant, and that the greatest absurdities are mixed with all
their speculations.<br />

    <p>Economists define modernization as the process by which humans
have increased their control over their physical environment as a
means to increasing per capita output. Sociologists and
anthropologists point out other features of modernization,
including the awakening and activation of the masses, more
interest in the present, and the future than in the past, a
tendency to view human affairs as understandable rather than as
manipulated by super natural forces, and, until recent years, a
faith in the beneficence of science and technology.<br />
From the viewpoint of world history the significance of this
modernization process is that it led inexorably to European
domination of the globe. The reason is that modernization
provided the Europeans not only with superior economic and
military power but also with superior sociopolitical cohesion and
dynamism. – Page 306</p>

    <p>These cities were dominated by the great merchant families who controlled
politics s well as trade and crafts. These families were the patrons of
Renaissance artists and writers. Their needs, interests, and tastes colored
the Renaissance cultural revival even though the patrons also included
ducal families such as Sforza of Milan, as well as popes such as Nicholas
V, Pius II, Julius II, and Leo X. This explains the secularism and humanism
of Renaissance – its concern with this world rather than the hereafter and
its focus on pagan classics rather than Christian theology.<br />
At the center of most Renaissance and literature was the person – the
new Renaissance person who was the molder of his or her own destiny rather
than the plaything of supernatural forces. People did not need to be
preoccupied with supernatural forces; rather, the purpose of life was to
develop ones’ innate potentialities. — Page 306 - 307</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The secularism and individualism of the Renaissance were reflected in its
scholarship and education. The so-called father of Renaissance litera,
Francesco Petraca, or Petrarch(1304 - 1374), stressed the value of the
classics as a means for self-improvement and a guide to social action. —

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, what is the significance of the Renaissance in the
perspective of world history? It is apparent that new emphasis on persons
and on what they could accomplish obviously was more conducive to overseas
expansion than the preceding medieval outlook. On the other hand, this
point can easily be exaggerated and needs serious modification. The fact is
that Renaissance Europe was not science-oriented. The leading figures
tended to be more aesthetic and philosophical than objective and
skeptical. They retained in various degrees certain medieval patterns of
thought. They persisted in admiring and believing the incredible and the
fantastic. They continued to seek the philosopher’s stone that would
convert other metals into gold. They still believed in astrology and
confused it with astronomy. – Page 309</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Europe’s economy was changed not only by the growing use of money but also
by the minting of standardized coins that were acceptable everywhere and by
the development of banks and of credit instruments. Florence led the way in
1252 with gold forin, and other cities and states soon followed. Simple
bills of exchange also apprears in Italy as early as the twelfth
century. Gradually, mighty banking families appeared, first in Italy and
later in northern Europe.<br />
What was happening to Europe, then, was a historic shift to a fundamentally
different type of economic system, the type know today as
capitalism. Capitalism has been defined as “… [a] system in which the
desire for profits is the driving motive and in which large accumulations of
capital are employed to make profits by various elaborate and often indirect
methods.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally significant for students of history is the fact that many laypersons
still cherish the vision of assorted Europeans, Asians, or Africans landing
on the shores of the pre-Columbian New World, bearing aloft the torch of
civilization. The fact is that humans today, as in earliest Paleolithic
times, are mesmerized by the cult of the mysterious. They cling to romantic
and simplistic explanations, even when they do not square with known
facts. Our food-gathering ancestors depended on their totems and shamans or
medicine men. Modern humans have similar faith in UFOs, numerology, tarot
cards, intelligent plants, and astrology. Readers of this text will
appreciate the significance of the following report by George Abell ,
professor of astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles:<br />
    I have polled the general university students taking my survey astronomy
    courses and find that about a thrid have an interest and belief in
    astrology. From discussion with my colleagues in other parts of the
    country I gather that about the same ratio holds everywhere and that it
    probably well represents the fraction of Americans who believe in
    astrology. It is estimated that there are more than 5,000 astrologers
    making a living in the subject in the United States. More than 1,200
    daily newspapers carry astrology columns.<br />
Professor Abell’s report was made in 1975. Polls since that date indicate
that faith in astrology is steadily increasing. Between 1980 and 1985 the
proportion of American teenagers who believe in astrology has grown from 40
to 55 percent. This resurgence of astrology today is especially noteworthy
in view of the fact that it largely disappeared when modern astronomy began
in the sixteen century.<br />
Similarly a 1996 <em>Newsweek</em> poll disclosed that 58 percent of Americans
believe UFOs (Unidentified Foreign Objects) are real, and 29 percent think
we’ve made contact with aliens, while another 48 percent believe there is a
government plot to cover it all up. More specifically, some stargazers claims
to have seen Elvis eating fried chicken on Uranus. Nor are Americans unique
in this respect. In France , nearly 50,000 taxpayers in 1995 declared
income from their work as stargazers, header, mediums, and similar
occupations. By contrast, France has 36,000 Roman Catholic priests and
6,000 psychiatrists.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my way to Peking I had to cross the whole of Siberia, Manchuria, and North
China,. No one an fail to be impressed by the journey through Siberia,
especially the first time. The dimensions of Russia are staggering. You
travel a day, you travel a week, you travel ten days, and you are still in
Russia. Except for the Ural Mountains and a stretch near Lake Baikal, the
country is absolutely flat.<br />
After you leave European Russia the population become very scarce, you pass
hours and hours without seeing any village or habitation. Near the stations
there are a few houses. Usually, when the express train arrives at the
station, the entire local population comes to stare at the
travelers. Especially in the evenings, when the train is brilliantly
illuminated by electricity and the elegant figures of some inhabitants of
Shanghai of other Far Eastern ports are visible inside, the travelers must
appear to the local residents like men from another planet. What envy and
dissatisfaction the exotic creatures in furs must provoke in the hearts of
those doomed to spent their entire life in some miserable station!<br />
I imagine a young girl who has nor yet lost the capacity to dream waiting on
the station platform. She hears the express approaching the sees it all
illuminated. The train stops for five minutes. The passengers,looking like
people from a fairy land., jump on the platform; they laugh and joke. There
i a whistle, the train with its passengers disappears, and darkness,
emptiness, and dullness reign again.<br />
It is unjust that some should move from place to place in luxury, while
others must remain in some forsaken place in misery. Small wonder that this
should cause irritation and discontent. I am convinced that the Siberian
express played an important part in the awakening of the population of
Siberia and thereby hasten the coming of the revolution. The sight of
unlimited space and the absence of life- begins to affect you, the passengers
prefer to pass their time in the diner, drinking endless glasses of tea and
playing cards….</p>

    <p>Although the Chinese, the Indians, and the Turks were unimpressed by
European culture during this period, the European, by contract, were very
much impressed by what they saw in Constantinople , in Delhi, and in
Peking. They became familiar first with the Ottoman Empire, and their
reaction was one of respect, admiration, and apprehension. As late as 1634,
after decline of the empire had set in, a thoughtful English traveler
concluded that the Turks were “the only modern people great in action” and
that “he who would behold these times in their greatest glory, could not
find a better scene than Turkey” During the seventeenth century the Ottoman
Empire lost prestige among Europeans. But at the same time European
intellectuals were becoming fascinated with numerous far-off Cathay. They
were entranced as they learned of China’s history, art, philosophy and
government. China came to be held up as a model civilization because of its
Confucian system of morals; its examination system for government service;
its respect for learning rather than for military prowess; and its exquisite
handicraft, including porcelain, silk, and lacquer work. Voltaire(1694 -
1778), for example, adorned the wail of his library with a portrait of
Confucius, and the German philosopher Leibniz(1646 - 1716) extolled the
Chinese emperor K’ang-hsi as “the monarchy .. who almost god-like mortal,
ruling all by a nod of his head, who, however, is educated to virtue and
wisdom … thereby earning the right to rule.”  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The century and a half between 1763 and 1914 stands out in the course of
world history as the period of European domination over a large part of the
globe. In 1763 Europe was still far from being the master of the world. It
had only coastal footholds in Africa and in Asia. But by 1914 the European
power had annexed the whole of Africa, and they had effectively established
their control over Asia: either directly, as in India and Southeast Asia,
or indirectly, as in the Chinese and Ottoman empires. The unprecedented
expansion of Europe was made possible by the continuation and acceleration
of the modernization process. This process was set in motion earlier by the
Renaissance, Reformation, technological development, capitalist
enterprise, state building and overseas expansion. These triggered a chain
reaction in the form of the three great revolutions – scientific,
industrial, and political – which gave Europe irresistible dynamism and
power.<br />
Two features of these revolutions might be noted at this point. One is that
they were well under way before 1763. The English Civil War, a major phase
of the political revolution, occurred in the 1640s, The scientific
revolution took place primarily during the century and a half between the
publication of Copernicus’ <em>Derevolutionibus orbium coelestium</em>(1543) and
of Newton’s <em>Principia</em>(1687). Likewise, the roots of the industrial
revolution were planed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when
the countries of northwestern Europe ‘‘were seething with such genuinely
capitalistic phenomena as systematic mechanical invention, company
formation, and speculation in the shares of financial and trading
concerns.’’ But the worldwide, impact of none of these revolutions was fully
felt until the nineteenth century. That is why we are considering them here
rather than earlier in this text.<br />
The other point to note about the three great revolutions is that they did
not run in parallel or independent lines. Scientific, industrial and
technological events were inderdependent and reacted continuously upon each
other. Nuewton’s discover of the laws governing the movements of heavenly
bodies and Darwin’s theories of biological evolutoin boath had profound
effects on political ideas. Likewise, we cold not conceive of modern
nationalism withough technological innvoations such as printing and the
telegraph. Conversely, politics affeced science, as in the case of the
French Revolutoin, which provided a powerful stimulus to scientific
advancemnt. Politics also affected economics, as was made claer by the
English manufacturer John Wilkinson, who stated bluntly, &#8220;manufacture and
commerce will awlwasy fourish most where Church and King interfere least’’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone agrees that this increase in the size of the economic cake has been
a great advantage. But there is much dispute over the question of how the
cake has been sliced. Colonial peoples feel that in the past they have had
less than their due share. The total amount that they have received obviously
has increased; otherwise their rising populations could not have been
supported. For example, a British economist has shown that in 1949 European
companies engaged in mining in mineral-rich northern Rhodesia(Zimbabwe) sold
their output for a total of f36.7 million. Of this, they spent only f12.5
million in northern Rhodesia, which meant that two-thirds of the money was
transferred abroad. Moreover, of the f12.5 million spent in northern
Rhodesia, f4.1 million was paid to European living and working there. Only
f2 million out of the f36.7 million went to the Africans working in the
mines. And yet these workers were receiving an average of f41 a year
compared to an average income of f27 a year per adult African male in the
colony.<br />
Under these circumstances it is understandable that colonial peoples are not
very impressed by increased productivity or by the wages paid by foreign
companies. They are more impressed by the wretched level at which they
subsist, especially in comparison with Western levels. They also resent
being cast in the role of hewers of wood and drawers of water, even in
regions where there are human and material resources for industrial
development. – Page 426</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Europe’s domination of the world in the nineteenth century was based not only
on its industrial and scientific revolutions but also on its political
revolution. The essence of the political revolution was the end of the
concept of a divinely ordained division of people into rulers and
ruled. Government was no longer regarded as something above the people and
the people as something below the government. Instead, the political
revolution for the first time history, at least on a scale larger than the
city-state, called for the identification of government with people. The
masses were awakened and activized so that they not only participated in
government but also considered it their inherent right to do so. – Page 428</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much influenced by the law of gravitation that Newton had demonstrated, the
philosopher believed in the existence of natural laws that regulated, on only
the physical universe, but also human society. Acting on this assumption,
they proceeded to apply reason to all fields in order to discover the natural
laws that operated in each. They subjected everything – all persons, all
institutions, all traditions – to the test of reason. What would be a
rigorous ordeal for any society in any period was particularly unsettling
for France’s ancient regime, past its prime and creaking in many joints. Thus
the philosopher subjected the old regime in France, and throughout Europe,
to a barrage of devastating criticism. More important, they evolved a set of
revolutionary principles by which  they proposed to effect a wholesale
reorganization of society. Of particular interest to us are their specific
proposals in three area – economics, religion , and government.<br />
Their key slogan in economics was laissez-fiare – let the people do what
they will, let nature takes its course. The opposition of government
intervention was a reaction to the rigid regulation of economic life
generally known as mercantilism. In the early period of state building,
mercantilism had been accepted as necessary for national security. But by
the eighteenth century it seems superfluous and damaging. The classic
account laissez-fiare was made by the Scotsman Adam Smith in his famous
work <em>An inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Walth of
Nations</em>(1776). He argued that individuals are motivated by self-interest as
far as their economic activities are concerned, that the national welfare is
simply the sum of the individual interests operating in a nation, and that
each man knows his own interest better than does any statesman.<br />
In religion the key slogan was Ecrasez l’infame – “crush the infamous
thing,” or stamp out religious fanaticism and intolerance. The philosophers
rejected the traditional belief that God controls the universe and
arbitrarily determines the fate of humanity. Instead, they sought a natural
religion that followed the dictates of reason. The outcome was a variety of
radical departures from religious orthodoxy. Some became outright atheists,
denying the existence of God and denouncing religion as a tool of priests
and politicians. Others became agnostics, who neither affirmed nor denied
the existence of God. The majority were deist, willing to go along with
proposition that God existed and had created the universe but insisting
that, after the act of creation, God allowed the universe to function
according to certain natural laws and refrained from intervention. Thus the
deists were able to have their cake and eat it too. They could accept God
and the teaching of Christianity and at the same time reject supernatural
features such as the virgin birth, the resurrection, the divinity of Christ,
and the divine inspiration of the Bible. The important point to note is that
all these new dogmas =- atheism, agnosticism, deism –reflected the
unprecedented growth of skepticism regarding “revealed” or “supernatural”
religion. For the first time since the triumph of Christianity in Europe, a
definite break had occurred with the Christians tradition.
In government, also, the philosophers had a key phrase – “the social
contract.” The contract theory of government was not new. The English
political theorist Jon Locke ahd formulated it in his <em>Essay on Civil
Government</em> (1690), in which he defined government as a political contract
between rulers and ruled. But the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
transformed it into a social rather than a political contract. For him it
involved an agreement among the people themselves. In his major political
work, <em>The Social Contract</em>(1762), Rousseau viewed government as imply a
“commission,” by which he justified revolution as a restoration to the
sovereign people of its rightful power. – Page 433</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The declaration set forth certain fundamental mental principles concerning
liberty, property, and security – “Men are born, and always continue, free
and equal, in respect of their right … The Nation is essentially the
source of all sovereignty .. law is an expression of the will of the
community .. liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not injure
another …” – Page 443</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberal doctrines were first clearly formulated and implemented during the
English Revolution. At that time, these doctrines were primarily those of
religious toleration and of security of perosn and of property against the
arbitrariness of the crown. Specifically, carrying out these doctrines
involved parliamentary control of government, the existence of independent
political parties, and the recognition of the need for, and the rights of,
opposition parties. – Page 448</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Karl Max(1818 - 1883), the father of modern socialism, differed
fundamentally from the Utopian Socialists in almost every respect. he was as
materialistic in his outlook as they were idealistic. He spent most of his
life studying the historical evolution and the precise functioning of the
existing capitalist society, whereas Utopians prepared blueprints of
modern communities. Marx was convinced from his study of history that
capitalism would be overthrown by class struggle and would be overthrown by
class struggle and would be replaced by a new type of socialist society. He
reached this conclusion because he believed that the wages paid to workers
were insufficient for them to buy what they produced. This inadequate
purchasing power eventually must lead to the closing of factories,
unemployment, a further decline of purchasing power, and, at length, a
full-scale depression. Furthermore, Marx believed that these depressions
would become increasingly frequent and severe until finally the unemployed
proletariat would be driven in desperation to revolution. In this way
capitalism would be replaced by socialism, as feudalism earlier had been by
capitalism. And the new socialistic society would be depression-proof
because, with government ownership of the means of production, there could
be no private employers, no profits, and the hence no lack of purchasing
power. – Page 450</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why the yawning and expanding chasm between the utopia expected by some
scientists an d the actually existing dystopia? The answer is to be found
in our cultures. All cultures of all peoples consist of control mechanisms
designed to regulate the behavior of society members. The cultures evolved
gradually during the historical evolution of the societies and therefore
represented their survival wisdom. The values comprising the various
cultures were calculated to enhance community cohesion and
survival. Consequently the values commonly incorporated in cultures favored
maximum fertility for species perpetuation, maximum productivity for
economic sustenance, and maximum military strength for physical survival.<br />
Through the millennia, cultures became the essential underpinnings of their
respective societies. Only through their cultures did individuals know what
they could do and how to do it. Therefore any threat to cultural values
became as serious as any threat to together basic necessities such as food
and water. Hence the extreme reluctance to tolerate any substantive
alternation or modification of traditional values. Hence also the historic
persistence of cultural rigidity, even in periods such as the present, when
rapid technological innovations necessitate correspondingly rapid social
innovations. But technological change customarily has been accepted and
welcomed because it normally raises living standards, while cultural change
has been feared and resisted because it threatens traditional and
comfortable values and practices.<br />
This dichotomy has prevailed throughout history, resulting in the social
stagnation amid the technological storms of our own making. The
disconnection has been responsible for much of the chronic violence and
bloodshed that have stained human history. It persists to the present, when
the disconnection is impacting directly and ominously on many phases of our
lives, as manifested incessantly o television screens and in newspaper
headlines.  — Page 657</p>

<p>我们这些人总有一死的。人的命运是多么奇特呀！我们每个人在这个世界上都只作一个短暂
的逗留；目的何在，却无所知，尽管有时自以为对此若有所感。但是，不必深思，只要从日
常生活就可以明白：人是为别人而生存的——首先是为那样一些人，他们的喜悦和健康关系着
我们自己的全部幸福；然后是为许多我们所不认识的人，他们的命运通过同情的纽带同我们
密切结合在一起。</p>

<p>我每天上百次地提醒自己：我的精神生活和物质生活都依靠别人（包括活着的人和死去的人）
的劳动，我必须尽力以同样的分量来报偿我所领受了的和至今还在领受的东西。我强烈地向
往着简朴的生活，我认为阶级的区分是不合理的，它最后所凭借的是以暴力为根据。我也相
信，简单淳朴的生活，无论在身体上还是在精神上，对每个人都是有益的。</p>

<p>我完全不相信人类会有那种在哲学意义上的自由。每一个人的行为，不仅受着外界的强迫，
而且还要适应内心的必然。叔本华（Schopenhauer）说，“人能够做他想做的，但不能要他
所想要的。”这句话从我青年时代起，就对我是一个非常真实的启示；在自己和别人生活面
临困难的时候，它总是使我得到安慰，并且永远是宽容的源泉。这种体会可以宽大为怀地减
轻那种容易使人气馁的责任感，也可以防止我们过于严肃地对待自己和别人；它还导致一种
特别给幽默以应有地位的人生观。</p>

<p>要追究一个人自己或一切生物生存的意义或目的，从客观的观点看来，我总觉得是愚蠢可笑
的。可是每个人都有一定的理想，这种理想决定着他的努力和判断的方向。就在这个意义上，
我从来不把安逸和快乐看作是生活目的本身——这种伦理基础，我叫他猪栏的理想。照亮我的
道路，并且不断地给我新的勇气去愉快地正视生活的理想，是善、美和真。要是没有志同道
合者之间的亲切感情，要不是全神贯注于客观世界——那个在科学与艺术工作领域永远达不到
的对象，那么在我看来，生活就会是空虚的。人们所努力追求的庸俗的目标——财产、虚荣、
奢侈的生活——我总觉得都是可鄙的。</p>

<p>我对社会正义和社会责任的强烈感觉，同我显然的对别人和社会直接接触的冷漠，两者总是
形成古怪的对照。我实在是一个“孤独的旅客”，我未曾全心全意地属于我的国家、我的家庭、
我的朋友，甚至我最接近的亲人；在所有这些关系面前，我总是感觉到有一定距离并且需要
保持孤独——而这种感受正与年俱增。人们会清楚地发觉，同别人的相互了解和协调一致是有
限度的，但这不足惋惜。这样的人无疑有点失去他的天真无邪和无忧无虑的心境；但另一方
面，他却能够在很大程度上不为别人的意见、习惯和判断所左右，并且能够不受诱惑要去把
他的内心平衡建立在这样一些不可靠的基础之上。</p>

<p>我的政治理想是民主主义。让每一个人都作为个人而受到尊重，而不让任何人成为崇拜的偶
像。我自己受到了人们过分的赞扬和尊敬，这不是由于我自己的过错，也不是由于我自己的
功劳，而实在是一种命运的嘲弄。其原因大概在于人们有一种愿望，想理解我以自己的微薄
绵力通过不断的斗争所获得的少数几个观念，而这种愿望有很多人却未能实现。我完全明白，
一个组织要实现它的目的，就必须有一个人去思考，去指挥，并且全面担负起责任来。但是
被领导的人不应该受到强迫，他们必须有可能来选择自己的领袖。</p>

<p>在我看来，强迫的专制制度很快就会腐化堕落。因为暴力所招引来的总是一些品德低劣的人，
而且我相信，天才的暴君总是由无赖来继承，这是一条千古不易的规律。就是这个缘故，我
总是强烈地反对今天我们在意大利和俄国所见到的那种制度。象欧洲今天所存在的情况，使

人无关的特征。我相信美国在这方面已经找到了正确的道路。他们选出一个任期足够长的总
统，他有充分的权力来真正履行他的职责。另一方面在德国的政治制度中，我所重视的是，
它为救济患病或贫困的人作出了比较广泛的规定。在人类生活的壮丽行列中，我觉得真正可
贵的，不是政治上的国家，而是有创造性的、有感情的个人，是人格；只有个人才能创造出
高尚的和卓越的东西，而群众本身在思想上总是迟钝的，在感觉上也是迟钝的。</p>

<p>讲到这里，我想起了群众生活中最坏的一种表现，那就是使我所厌恶的军事制度。一个人能
够洋洋得意地随着军乐队在四列纵队里行进，单凭这一点就足以使我对他轻视。他所以长了
一个大脑，只是出于误会；单单一根脊髓就可以满足他的全部需要了。文明国家的这种罪恶
渊薮应当尽快加以消灭。由命令而产生的勇敢行为，毫无意义的暴行，以及在爱国主义名义
下一切可恶的胡闹，所有这些都使我深恶痛绝！在我看来，战争是多么卑鄙、下流！我宁愿
被千刀万刮，也不愿参与这种可憎的勾当。尽管如此，我对人类的评价还是十分高的，我相
信，要是人民的健康感情没有被那些通过学校和报纸而起作用的商业利益和政治利益加以有
计划的破坏，那么战争这个妖魔早就该绝迹了。</p>

<p>我们所能有的最美好的经验是神秘的经验。它是坚守在真正艺术和真正科学发源地上的基本
感情。谁要是体验不到它，谁要是不再有好奇心也不再有惊讶的感觉，他就无异于行尸走肉，
他的眼睛是迷糊不清的。就是这种神秘的经验——虽然掺杂着恐怖——产生了宗教。 我们认识
到某种为我们所不能洞察的东西存在，感觉到那种只能以其最原始的形式为我们所感受到的
最深奥的理性和最灿烂的美——正是这种认识和这种情感构成了真正的宗教感情；在这个意义
上，而且也只是在这个意义上，我才是一个具有深挚宗教感情的人。</p>

<p>我无法想象一个会对自己的创造物加以赏罚的上帝，也无法想象它会有象在我们自己身上所
体验到的那样一种意志。我不能也不愿去想象一个人在肉体死亡以后还会继续活着；让那些
脆弱的灵魂，由于恐惧或者由于可笑的唯我论，去拿这种思想当宝贝吧！我自己只求满足于
生命永恒的奥秘，满足于觉察现存世界的神奇结构，窥见它的一鳞半爪，并且以诚挚的努力
去领悟在自然界中显示出来的那个理性的一部分，即使只是其极小的一部分，我也就心满意
足了。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post notes down my current understanding of the intuition behind using
complex exponentials to represent function, stressing on the connection between
the complex form and the normally all real form.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="brief-note-on-complex-number">Brief Note on Complex Number</h2>

<p>One of the most useful properties of complex number is its ability to unify
algebraic and geometrical operations. More about this could be found on
<a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-intuitive-guide-to-imaginary-numbers/">Better Explained</a>
which is a good elementary explanation of imaginary number.</p>

<p>It was not until seriously studying Fourier Transformation that I figured out
the nature of Complex Number.</p>

<p>Number system is human’s way to model nature. Integer number models
counting. Negative number models things like debt. Zero models null. Fraction
number models division and fraction. Those consist of rational number. But to
really model length, which occurs naturally in Pythagoran theorem, irrational
number has to be introduced. Rational number and irrational number together
make up real number system, where limit of points – may be compared with
limit of length is regarded as a conceptual number, to make the system
complete(complete is a mathematical terminology).</p>

<p>But all those models are for scalar. Nature is not one dimensional. It is
rules of vector that engine this world. This is where complex comes
from. </p>

<p>The most elegant equation in the history is Euler Equation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
e^{ix} = cos(x) + i sin(x)
</script>

<p><img class="center" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Euler%27s_formula.svg" title="Euler Equation Illustration" /></p>

<p>It is saying that every complex exponential is a 2D vector, where $(x, y) =
(cos\phi, sin\phi)$. Instead of just modeling scalar, we model 2D vector using
complex number. So by manipulating algebra of complex, we are doing geometrical
operations. And the meaning of imaginary $i$ is rotating the vector 90 degree
anti-clockwise. That’s the reason why it connects algebra and geometry.</p>

<p>This will be clearer after Fourier related stuff is introduced in the following
sections.</p>

<p>I am still wondering if we could unify more dimensions into number instead of
just two?</p>

<h2 id="fourier-series">Fourier Series</h2>

<p>Fourier Series is about this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every periodic function could be represented using arbitrary number of
ocsillating functions, namely cosines and sines or complex exponentials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted in the beginning, this post is about intuition behind the relationship
between cosines sines and complex exponentials.</p>

<p>First we see fourier series in its real form decomposition.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
f(t) = \sum\limits_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} c_{n}cos(nw_{0}t + \phi)
</script>

<p>We could also write it in form of $sin(t)$ given that it is just a shifted
version of $cos(t)$. But we will see that using $cos(t)$ makes sense in a
moment.</p>

<p>NOW, every $cos(nw_{0}t + \phi)$ is the real part of $e^{i(nw_{0}t + \phi)}$.
Remember that the algebra operations between complex exponentials are
equivalent to vector operations. So instead seeing combination of different
Fourier components as superposition of constantly changing(with regard to $t$)
scalar addition, we see it as vector addition in a 2D dimensional complex
plane. See illustration
<a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/">here</a>,
in about half the article.</p>

<p>Though they vibrate in circle, which indicates the way the interact with each
other, we only see its effect – cosine(real) part. So each time we measure or
in other word, sample, we get the real part, which is the final function we
want.</p>

<p>By converting back and forth between the real form and complex form, you will
find terms related to frequency $s$ is $cos(st + \phi)$ and
$\frac{1}{2}e^{ist}e^{i\phi} + \frac{1}{2}e^{-ist}e^{-i\phi}$. The negative
frequency part is used to “drag” back or cancel out the imaginary or the part
that is orthogonal to real part. Or in other word, we only want the real part.</p>

<p>Intuitively, it means to make the decomposition conforming with observation, we
use conjugation to drag the vector back to real line. Now it makes sense that
we choose $cos(nw_{0}t + \phi)$ to decompose instead of $sin(nw_{0}t +
\tau)$. Cosine is related to the x-axis by definition which is real line.</p>

<p>We could stop here. The connection between the real form and the complex form
is pretty clear now. But there is more, in a finer level.</p>

<p>Given that each components of the decomposition is orthogonal, now we need only
to consider one of its term $cos(nw_{0}t + \phi)$.</p>

<p>From now on for notation simplicity we denote $nw_{0}$ as $s$. Each component
could also be decomposed into two components, remembering that we see each
component as two dimension vector. The phase $\phi$ determines the vector
initially. We can see this clearer by expanding($1/2$ is dropped for
convenience):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
e^{ist}e^{i\phi} + e^{-ist}e^{-i\phi} = e^{ist}(cos(\phi) + i sin(\phi)) +
e^{-ist}(cos(\phi) - i sin(\phi))
</script>

<p>THIS actually means in a finer level, the innate vector property is also
modeled – every component consists of two basic components, sine and cosine
and $\phi$ decides how they combine with each other initially, which determines
how they interact with each other forever.</p>

<p>The decomposition into sine and cosine also makes a lot of sense. cos is
orthogonal to sine and together they can represent any trigonometric function.</p>

<h2 id="note-on-other-derivation">Note On Other Derivation</h2>

<p>There is another way to get real form of fourier series to complex
form. Actually it is the first time I realize the connection between them,
though fourier was learned way earlier(TERRIBLE COLLEGE EDUCATION!!!).</p>

<p>Fourier decomposition is written the following way:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
f(t) = \sum\limits_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} c_{n}sin(nw_{0}t + \phi)
</script>

<p>By some derivation, we have:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
f(t) = \sum\limits_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} a_{n} cos(nw_{0}t) + b_{n}sin(nw_{0}t)
</script>

<p>The phase is merge into coefficients $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$.</p>

<p>Given $sin(t) = \frac{1}{2i}(e^{it} - e^{-it})$ and $cos(t) = \frac{1}{2}(e^{it} + e^{-it})$,
substitute above equations in, we also get the complex form.</p>

<p>This approach is harder to understand because it gets the atomic level wrong –
it should be $e^{it}$ not $cos(t) + i sin(t)$. But it does have benefits.</p>

<p>Each function $f$ could be decompose into a combination of even and odd part
by:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
f = \frac{1}{2}(f(t) + f(-t)) + \frac{1}{2}(f(t) - f(-t))
</script>

<p>The formed is the even part and the latter is the odd part. Let $f(t) = e^{it}$
we can see that $i sin(t)$ the odd part of $e^{it}$ and $cos(t)$ the even part.</p>

<p>It makes clear that when the function is even, we get zero value in coefficients
of $sin(t)$ while when the function is odd, we get zero value in coefficients
of $cos(t)$: if a function has a odd component $sin(t)$, it never is going to
be even.</p>

    <link href="http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2015/04/07/a-preliminary-summary-on-what-cnn-is-doing-mathematically/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-07T19:05:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2015/04/07/a-preliminary-summary-on-what-cnn-is-doing-mathematically</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is too much to stuff all those notes into one weekly summary, so I decide
to decouple it into this post. It is about a description of the process what
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is doing mathematically.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Last week I have written an informal one. The informality was resulted from an
unclear understanding of space, mapping and the way CNN works. Things get much
clearer now.</p>

<p>The task CNN is trying to achieve is the same with all the other machine
learning algorithms – finding a mapping that will transform the preliminary
input to one kind of output that makes the task easier to solve or directly
solve the task. The formed one is called feature learning and the latter is
called classification or anything else that is the target.</p>

<p>The problem is how exactly such mapping is found? Or more specifically, why CNN
is more powerful than other algorithms?</p>

<h2 id="how-mapping-is-found-mathematically">How Mapping Is Found Mathematically</h2>

<p>First we address the first problem, though those two are actually the same.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to find a mapping to our problem directly, which are methods
called shallow model today, CNN tries to find a sequence of mappings to
decouple information from its most primitive form. If we rephrase the word
mapping to operation, it may sound more like plain English. Then judging from
the information extracted, it answers whatever relevant questions we are
interested, such as classification of images of different animals.</p>

<p>More mathematically, CNN tries to find the mapping by finding a representation
of the mapping on relevant bases which are found by compositing preliminary
bases. Then in the space represented by the relevant bases, divide the new
space using previous shallow model.</p>

<p>The latter part has not been investigated fully yet. I guess support vector
machine may be the key to this problem.</p>

<p>Further zooming in the process, in each layer, every kernel of CNN will
convolute with the input. In the first layer, the input is the raw signal. In
the following layer, the input is the output of last layer. A kernel here is a
basis. Convoluting with input is actually taking inner product with input.</p>

<p>In the first layer, by computing the inner product of a basis function with a
signal, we get a value. This value is one way to look at the signal, or the
information extracted which may be comprehended by human, like the existence of
a certain of kind edge. By taking inner product of all bases, we get the
signal’s representation in form of coordinates of the set of bases.</p>

<p>From now on, the task is to find combinations of the first layer’s bases that
are more informative. By using more layers, we hope to find relevant
combinations in exponential number of possible ones.</p>

<p>The most preliminary bases actually have mathematical terminology: in the
continuous case, it is called Schauder basis; in the discrete case, it is
called Hamel basis. In this case, the coordinates of the signal is the same
with its ground truth value.</p>

<p>Feature mappings from previous layer to current layer are the key to find a
more complex bases. It brings the search in the space of preliminary bases to a
more advanced space of more advanced bases. A best example is an input in form
of a three channel image will have three feature mappings, one corresponding to
one color. If we just concatenate three pixels of different color, we have no
idea it corresponds to different frequencies of light. But if we take it from
three channels, we are using the high-level information of colors. Another
example is provided in the next section.</p>

<p>Now the process up to the first part of the process is done. The second part
will not be described given that I have not understood it fully yet.</p>

<p>The followings are some notes on properties of such process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The key of depth is reusing information hierarchically and preventing
exploration on meaningless part of function space. This is the main reason
why deep model works and will be elaborated with an example in the next
section.</li>
  <li>Coordinates are coordinates. There is only one ground truth of
nature. Coordinates are the way we see the ground truth. Different spaces
are actually different with different levels of abstraction. Different
levels of abstraction are achieved using different sets of bases.</li>
  <li>Taking inner product is the process to map point in one space to another
space. This is also the intuition behind Riesz Theorem that any linear
functional could be represented using inner product.</li>
  <li>The intuition of taking inner product is also computing correlation between
the basis and the signal. The more they are similar, the bigger the
coordinate(in CNN terminology system, the bigger the response). </li>
  <li>Bases are connected with hidden factors referred by Bengio.</li>
  <li>Spatial information is kept by the intuition of cascading local receptive
fields.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="analytically-why-more-depth-is-more-powerful">Analytically Why More Depth Is More Powerful</h2>

<p>Imagine a square whose components are two horizontal edges and two vertical
edges. To detect such shape, we could imagine a three layer convolutional
neural network. In the first layer of filters, we have two kernels – one
for horizontal edges and one for vertical edges. Write them in matrix form,
they are like this:</p>

<p>Horizontal Edge Kernel</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>and Vertical Edge Kernel</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>The square we are going to detect is like this:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

\begin{bmatrix}
1   & 1 & 1 & 1 &  1 \\
1   & 0 & 0 & 0 &  1 \\
1   & 0 & 0 & 0 &  1 \\
1   & 0 & 0 & 0 &  1 \\
1   & 1 & 1 & 1 &  1 
\end{bmatrix}
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>As we moving the two kernels, we get response similar like this:</p>

<p>feature map for horizontal edge detection kernel:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

\begin{bmatrix}
x & 1 & x \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
x & 1 & x
\end{bmatrix}
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>and feature map for vertical edge detection kernel:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

\begin{bmatrix}
x & 0 & x \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
x & 0 & x
\end{bmatrix}
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>$x$ is the response of angle, which may not be black and white. And since they
are not very influential to our discussion, it is denoted $x$.</p>

<p>In the next convolution layer, the input are two feature maps, then the kernel
for detecting square will be like:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

\begin{bmatrix}
x & 1 & x \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
x & 1 & x
\end{bmatrix}
and
\begin{bmatrix}
 x & 0 & x \\
 1 & 0 & 1 \\
 x & 0 & x
\end{bmatrix}
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>The final inner product will be normalized to one. In this case, we are only
using four kernels.</p>

<p>If we switch to one layer CNN, The kernel for detecting square will be like:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

\begin{bmatrix}
x   & 1 & 1 & 1 & x \\
1   & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1   & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1   & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
x   & 1 & 1 & 1 & x
\end{bmatrix}
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>The zero and one is expanded because each edges consist of more than one
pixels. Three here is used for illustration.</p>

<p>It seems that we can detect shape only using one kernel. But wait… we are not
only trying to detect only square. We should also try to detect circle,
rectangles etc… So we will have more than more kernels. In this case, the
space of possible number of kernels will exponentially explode given the
possible changes we may swap the zero and one in the pixels of kernels.</p>

<p>But in previous three layer cases, the space of possible changes are shrunk
dramatically. The key here is explained in previous section, we are reusing the
information that only consecutive edges are sensible combination of pixels and
the number of possibilities of changing locations of edges is much smaller than
changing values of pixels.</p>

    <link href="http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2015/03/28/how-do-we-create-meaningful-many-dimensional-space/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-28T20:58:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2015/03/28/how-do-we-create-meaningful-many-dimensional-space</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post should be the third notes on understanding fundamentals of Analysis,
or in a more broad sense, understanding fundamental of Mathematics, though some
other randoms post are written previously.
The <a href="http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2013/12/24/axiomization-of-natural-number/">first</a>
 is about the axiomization of Natural Number. It gives the exact definition of
natural number, whose concept is taken for granted for most people. The
<a href="http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2014/09/30/why-and-how-we-construct-real-number-system/">second</a>
is about the construction of Real Number System. It offers a complete field
which all the remaining Mathematics is built on.</p>

<p>The above two posts are both in essential, one dimensional. They are the
infrastructure of univariate function, univariate calculus and other univariate
Math subjects. After building the one dimensional infrastructure, the next step
is to step in the world of more than one – two dimensional, three dimensional,
finite dimensional, and the infinite dimensional, which all will be called many
dimensional space in this post.</p>

<p>So this is about how do we create meaningful many dimensional space that
suitable for the real world problem. In such space, we could deal with, two
dimensional plane, three dimensional space, ultimately countably infinite
dimensional space and uncountably infinite dimensional space, furthermore, the
one of the most important subjects in modern analysis – function space.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="the-leap-to-abstract-mathematics">The Leap to Abstract Mathematics</h2>

<p>Such transition is a great leap in the development of Mathematics. It makes
Mathematics become more and more abstract. The inevitability is showed in the
following. As having been numbered before, there are at least four extremely
common many dimensional space we must deal with: two dimensional, three
dimensional, which we are familiar with; countably infinite dimensional space,
for instance, countable sequences, which is quite common; uncountably infinite
dimensional space, for instance the space of all continuous function defined on
$R$, which some may not be very familiar. Actually, there is a lot more than
that since at least we would have a number of spaces such as 7D and 8D etc.. So
mathematicians cannot deal with those spaces be copying the way they deal with
$R$. They have to find a way to see those thing in common. In the popular word
of programmers, they need to abstract them. Ha ha, programming is great, right?</p>

<p>Consequently, here comes Abstract Algebra, General Topology and ultimately,
Functional Analysis. Let get to know what these three terms are about(but it is
highly probable that you have no idea what I am talking about given learning
Math is far from learning concepts): Abstract Algebra is about abstracting common
operations that is used in $R$, which is called using the terminology algebraic structure. For
instance, a ring is an algebraic structure with operations generalizing the
arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. So such operation will
not only be able to be applied to number, but to polynomials, matrices and
etc..[1] More word may be find in this rather old post on
<a href="http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2013/12/24/basis-of-algebra-structure/">Basic of Algebra Structure</a>;
General Topology is about the mathematical study of shapes and topological
spaces. It is an area of mathematics concerned with the properties of space
that are preserved under continuous deformations including stretching and
bending, but not tearing or gluing[2]. The sets with the same properties are
called open set. Abstract Algebra abstracts operations of $R$. General Topology
abstracts objects or points of $R$. With objects and operations on those
objects, we could analyze them, where comes Functional Analysis(Though
Functional Analysis is just about analyze functions, all machinery developed
above is to try to deal with function space. So the problem and technique in
Functional Analysis could all be applied to other many dimensional space).</p>

<h2 id="hilbert-space">Hilbert Space</h2>

<p>Once we have abstract stuff, things could become very weird given that we could
tweak the stuff anyway we want. But the key is to remember why we initiate the
search for an abstract solution for solving real world problem. So the light to
guide the abstract construction is to let things meet natural intuitions. This
is the point I learned hardest while teaching myself functional analysis, which
is the thread that guides me to bridge the gap between those highly abstract
concepts to the details in the real world problems I aim to solve.</p>

<p>Hilbert Space is the solution to the question posed at the beginning – finding
a meaningful many dimensional space. From now on, why Hilbert Space fits with
natural intuition will be elaborated. But keep in mind that though
understanding intuition playing a very important role in learning Mathematics,
it is never sufficient, a large amount of information is skipped at the time
Abstract Algebra and General Topology is introduced above. It is the process to
learning them, to do exercise that gives me such intuition.</p>

<p>A natural step following one number, denoted $\xi$, is to list a tuple
$(\xi_{1}, \xi_{2})$. $\xi_{1}$ could be the size of one department and
$\xi_{2}$ could be the price of the department. We take it in tuple maybe
because to want to investigate something that is related to those two
both. Then naturally, we would like to extend it to $(\xi_{1} \ldots
\xi_{n})$, then $(\xi_{1} \ldots \xi_{n}), n = 1 \ldots \infty$,
which is called countably infinite, then $(\xi_{1} \ldots \xi_{n})$, where we
regard $\xi_{i}$ is as dense(note the dense does not mean its usual meaning in
topology) as point in $R$(this sentence is actually mathematically wrong given
the incountablity of the set, but it makes the point through more easily),
which is called uncountably finite. Each instance of previous examples is a
point in its space. For instance, $(\xi_{1} \ldots \xi_{n}), n = 1 \ldots
\infty$ is a point in the space of all possible value of $\xi_{i}$. The point
is actually called vector and the space is noted as Vector Space defined on
Field $R$ or $C$ if it is complex.</p>

<p>Again, the natural question to ask is how much similarity with $R$ we could
keep while generalizing? This is the process we construct the meaningful many
dimensional space. The answer is that we want to get completeness, compactness,
connectivity, which are contents of topology and metric space, “absolute value”
of point, which is the content of Normed Vector Space, “length” of “lines”
which is the content of Real Analysis and others. Given the limitation of time,
none of them will be covered here. The point of this post is to try to note
down the hardest to understood properties kept after generalization –
geometric intuition on 2D or 3D space.</p>

<p>What is the geometric intuition I am talking about?</p>

<p>In Normed Vector Space, we could assign any norm we want, for instance, $L^{p}$
norm. But it seems  2-norm, also Euclidean norm that is the most natural norm
for we human. But why it is the most natural one? How do we define natural?</p>

<p>The following are some direct answer:</p>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper left"><img class="caption" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2428233/6881526/a9f838a8-d59d-11e4-8b39-52e744eff47e.png" width="" height="" title="Geometric Proof of Pythagoras Theorem" /><span class="caption-text">Geometric Proof of Pythagoras Theorem</span></span></p>

<ol>
  <li>As we rotate one vector, its length will not change in 2-norm, but not other
norms.</li>
  <li>It makes Pythagoras Theorem held. So when we drop the coordinate system, and
see vectors in pure geometric way, its length will still be the same.</li>
</ol>

<p>But those all special phenomenon of one underlying truth – 2-norm could be
derived from inner product(Besides completeness, it is inner product that plays
the most important role in the definition of Hilbert Space), and inner product
gives angle a sensible definition.</p>

<p>Before we elaborate the point, let us think a minute about what exactly angle
is? This is again one blind spot that we take for granted, at least me.</p>

<p>Try searching on its wikipedia page. Actually we cannot define angle like we
define natural number using Peano Axiom. We are told it is some thing that is
between two straight line or defined it through trigonometric function, which
is essentially ratio, in high school. Underlying those definition, we are
actually define it through its behavior. This makes sense, since ultimately,
angles do not exist on their own and are the relation between lines.</p>

<p>But we could model such relationship using one entity – inner product. Angle
could be defined as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

\theta = arccos\frac{<x, y>}{||x||||y||}
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>Through this way, angle is connected with value(coordinates) of lines(vectors)
naturally. As angle is kept, our intuition is actually kept. More specifically
the intuition of rotation, orthogonality and projection are all kept. Those are
what we call natural.</p>

<p>To make sense of it, it is recommended to prove polarization identity using
property of inner product and law of cosine using elementary geometry
method(polarization identity and law of cosine are the same theorem in different
names in different contexts).</p>

    <link href="http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2015/03/27/how-to-convert-djvu-file-to-pdf-with-text-kept/"/>

    <id>http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2015/03/27/how-to-convert-djvu-file-to-pdf-with-text-kept</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally, I have come up with a solution to convert Djvu format e-book to Pdf
format. This post is going to note down exactly HOW.</p>

<p>First, some background about why I am doing this.</p>

<p>In the ancient time, well-know scholars are proud of their collection of books
in their personal library, which is the physical incarnation of their knowledge
and journey of learning. Although still a majority of people prefers the old
way of reading paper books, the way to keep one’s collection of books is going
to change to the electronic format way eventually. There are three significant
benefits of doing this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You are able to bring with you all your books anywhere without any extra
effort.</li>
  <li>E-books are searchable, which speed up your reading a lot.</li>
  <li>You can open multiple copies of your book at the same time so the cross
reference is much more easier than reading paper version.</li>
</ol>

<p>But one major drawback of the past years where I almost read e-books
exclusively is that at the time when I can only find djvu format of certain
files, I have no way to highlight text on the e-book, especially for Math
books, a lot of which are in djvu format.</p>

<p>After meeting with one file that I must take note, I decide to figure out a
solution. So here it is.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Basically, the mechanism works like this. We extract image and text from the
original djvu files separately. Then we create the wanted pdf with them.</p>

<p>The solution is a combination of several open source tools:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://jwilk.net/software/ocrodjvu">djvu2hocr</a>. It is a wrapper for OCR
systems, that allows you to perform OCR on DjVu files. Optical character
recognition (OCR) is the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of
typewritten or printed text into machine-encoded text.</li>
  <li><a href="http://djvu.sourceforge.net/">ddjvu</a>. We use it to decode image from djvu
file. It is part of the open source project DjVuLibre that offers program to
manipulate djvu files. But one of the most pity is that no program it offers
could add highlight and annotations to djvu in a GUI way. I think this is
one of the major reasons djvu cannot catch on besides some other big
reasons.</li>
  <li><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/pdfbeads">pdfbeads</a>. PDFBeads is a small utility
written in Ruby which takes scanned page images and converts them into a
single PDF file.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">gs</a> PostScript and PDF language interpreter
and previewer. If you are using a modern UNIX environment, it is highly
possible you would have it installed by default. We need this when deal with
djvu books, since pdfbeads creates very large intermediate files which makes
converting large books infeasible. So we need to create pdf pages one by one
and use gs to merge them.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="installation">INSTALLATION</h2>

<p>Only installation on Ubuntu is going to be described.</p>

<h3 id="ocrodjvu">ocrodjvu</h3>

<p><code>djvu2hocr</code> and <code>ddjvu</code> are from <code>ocrodjvu</code>.</p>

<p>ocrodjvu is in the official repository, so just type in:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">sudo apt-get install ocrodjvu
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h3 id="pdfbeads">pdfbeads</h3>

<p><code>pdfbeads</code> is written in ruby. The package manager <code>gem</code> of ruby will handle
dependency in ruby but there are some addition library header needed to be
installed depending on your operating system. As for me, <code>libleptonica-dev</code> is
needed. Type in:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">sudo apt-get install libleptonica-dev
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.leptonica.com/">Leptonica</a> is a pedagogically-oriented open
source site containing software that is broadly useful for image processing
and image analysis applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have not done a lot image manipulation, it is highly probable that you
also need to install <code>libmagickwand-dev</code>:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>It mainly installs development package for ImageMagick. From its websites,
it is a:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.leptonica.com/">ImageMagick</a>® is a software suite to create,
edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read and write images in a
variety of formats (over 200) including PNG, JPEG, JPEG-2000, GIF, TIFF, DPX,
EXR, WebP, Postscript, PDF, and SVG. Use ImageMagick to resize, flip, mirror,
rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply
various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and Bézier
curves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And to ensure we are getting a reasonable size of pdf finally, we need to
use <a href="http://jbig2.com/">JBIG2</a> compression instead of TIFF G4 when creating
pdf. JBIG2 is an International Telecommunication Union format that represents a
revolutionary breakthrough in captured document technology. Using JBIG2
encoding, a scanned image can be compressed up to 10x smaller than with TIFF
G4.</p>

<p>This time we need to compile it from
<a href="https://github.com/agl/jbig2enc">source</a>. Standard pipe is good:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">./autogen.sh
</span><span class="line">./configure
</span><span class="line">make
</span><span class="line">make install <span class="o">(</span>or sudo make install<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I have done a simple test on how much more compress JBIG2 could offer. Using
TIFF G4, one random chosen page of my djvu file will be 77K, while it is 21K
using JBIG2. Considering that the final output size of my pdf file is 49M, it
would beyond 100M if I used TIFF G4, which is too big for a pdf book.</p>

<p>With all prerequisite ready, we could install pdfbeads now:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">sudo gem install pdfbeads
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h3 id="gs">gs</h3>

<p><code>gs</code> should be available already on Ubuntu.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Basic usage for small file could be found on
<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/46233/converting-djvu-to-pdf">Converting DJVU to PDF</a>,
where I learned how to convert djvu file.</p>

<p>But if you want to convert something that is a book, converting it directly
using the method in the above link is going to crash your PC, at least freeze
it until you kill the process because pdfbeads is creating very huge
intermediate files. It exceeded 10G before I killed it in my case.</p>

<p>So to deal with the case, I write a script to process djvu file page by page
and merge all the pdf pages in the end. The script could be found on
<a href="https://github.com/shawnLeeZX/daily_tools/blob/master/djvu_2_pdf.sh">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="remark-on-other-solution">Remark on Other Solution</h2>

<p>Before I dived in all those complicated tools, I tried to some easier
solutions, including online converter and <code>gscan2pdf</code>. They both does not
work. <code>gscan2pdf</code> is capable of converting djvu to pdf with text. But it may
have trouble handling hundreds of pages ones given the error report I got.</p>

    <link href="http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2014/12/16/a-dig-into-definition-of-continuity/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-16T15:04:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://shawnLeeZX.github.io/blog/2014/12/16/a-dig-into-definition-of-continuity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about explaining intuitions behind the definition of
continuity, in calculus context and topological context, with a focus
on why it is not defined in the other way around. A number of counter
examples are provided.</p>

<p>Note that between calculus context and topological context, there is
still one intermediate step which is metric space context. But it is
basically not different too much in the calculus context so I omit it.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="puzzle-in-calculus-context">Puzzle in Calculus Context</h2>

<p>In Calculus continuity is defined in the following way:</p>

<p>Given a function $f(x)$, we call $f$ is continuous at point $c$, if
for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a $\delta &gt; 0$, for $|x - c|
&lt; \delta$ the value of $f(x)$ satisfies</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>The intuition continuity want to capture is if there is a small change
in the input(the independent variable), there should be a
corresponding small change in the output(the dependent variable).</p>

<p>It is the small change in $x$ that causes small change in $y$, where
$y$ denotes $f(x)$, but why the definition of continuity is <em>for any
$\epsilon$</em>, which is the change of $y$, <em>there is a $\delta$</em>, which
is the change of $x$? Why not define it as the following way.</p>

<p>Given a function $f(x)$, we call $f$ is continuous at point $c$, if
for any $\delta &gt; 0$, there exists a $\epsilon &gt; 0$, for $|x - c|
&lt; \delta$ the value of $f(x)$ satisfies</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% &lt;![CDATA[

|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon
 %]]&gt;</script>

<p>I puzzled on this for a long time but now it feels obvious that the
latter definition is wrong. Before counter example is put forward, I
will explain why the former definition is right.</p>

<p>The point is that it is $y$ that we want to constrain. So for whatever
change $y$ is made as long as it is in the neighborhood of $\epsilon$,
$x$ within the neighborhood of $\delta$ will capture it all. In more
plain English, the change is all caused by those $x$.</p>

<p>Now time for a counter example.</p>

<p>Consider $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ defined for $x &gt; 0$. Then $lim_{x
\rightarrow 0.5} f(x) = 2$ in the usual sense. Yet in this case, with
$\delta = \frac{1}{2}$, there is no $\epsilon &gt; 0$ such that $0 &lt; |
x - 0.5| &lt; \delta$ implies $|f(x) - 2| &lt; \epsilon$.</p>

<p>This example comes from
<a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/993866/switching-the-definition-of-epsilon-delta-limit">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="puzzle-in-topology-context">Puzzle in Topology Context</h2>

<p>If we generalize continuity to topological space. Then it is defined
as following.</p>

<p>Mapping of a topological space $(X, T_X)$ into a topological space
$(Y, T_Y)$ is continuous if and only if the inverse image $f^{−1}(W)$
of every open set $W \in T_Y$ is open, i.e. $f^{−1}(W) \in T_X$.</p>

<p>Again why it is not defined in the reverse way:</p>

<p>Mapping of a topological space $(X, T_X)$ into a topological space
$(Y, T_Y)$ is continuous if and only if the image $f(W)$ of every open
set $W \in T_X$ is open, i.e. $f(W) \in T_Y$.</p>

<p>The second definition is called <em>Open mapping</em>, which means map an open
set to an open set.</p>

<p>Similar with the intuition explained in previous section, the
definition of open mapping dose not imply constraint on the image
mapped. <a href="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/62395.html">Here</a> is
an educational example. It constructs a mapping which is open but not
continuous, from $R$ with usual topology to $[0 1]$ with usual
topology. One intuition behind is that even if the image mapped is
open set, no constraint is imposed so it could be too large compared
with the pre-image of it.</p>

<p>If we drop $R$ all together, and only think of open set in the
topological sense. We could think open set as a thing with
semidecidable properties. Below is an explanation from
<a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/932942/why-are-continuous-functions-the-right-morphisms-between-topological-spaces">here</a>. I
copy it here for integrity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>General topology is actually a kind of logic. I don’t know who this
insight is due to, but see Vickers’ Topology via Logic for much more
on this theme. In particular, the open subsets of a topological
space should be thought of as axiomatizing semidecidable properties:
properties that you can confirm but not necessarily disconfirm,
given limited tools (e.g. finite time and precision).</p>

  <p>For example, you can confirm whether two things are less than 5
inches apart by measuring the distance between them to finite
precision and seeing if it’s less than 5, so an open ball of radius
5 in a metric space describes a semidecidable property, but you
can’t confirm whether two things are less than or equal to 5 inches
apart by measuring the distance between them to finite precision
because if you get 4.99±0.2 inches you don’t know whether that’s
over or under 5.</p>

  <p>Semidecidability can be used to justify all of the topological space
axioms, which is a nice exercise. For example, arbitrary unions of
open sets are open because given a method of confirming whether
you’re in each of those open sets, you get a method of confirming
whether you’re in any of them by running all of the methods
simultaneously and waiting for one to finish. But you only get
finite intersections when you try to do the same thing for waiting
for all of the methods to finish because method n might take n
seconds finish.</p>

  <p>Continuous functions then axiomatize “computable functions”: for f
to be continuous means that it should be possible to compute f(x)
“to arbitrary precision” by computing x “to arbitrary precision,”
where going off of the example of metric spaces “to arbitrary
precision” means “to within an arbitrary open set,” since it’s
semidecidable whether f(x) is contained within an open set. In other
words, to locate f(x) within some open set U, it suffices to locate
x within some open set V. After a moment’s thought you’ll see that
this is precisely the condition that f−1(U)=V.</p>

  <p>(I particularly like this justification of topological spaces and
continuity because, unlike the justification coming from thinking
about metric spaces, it continues to apply to spaces that aren’t
Hausdorff, and in fact it tells you what it means for a space to not
be Hausdorff. One equivalent definition of being Hausdorff is that
the diagonal {(x,x)∈X×X} is closed in X×X. This is equivalent to
“x≠y” being semidecidable, so a space fails to be Hausdorff
precisely when “x≠y” fails to be semidecidable.)</p>

<p>I would like to read <em>Topology Via Logic</em> some day.</p>

<p>Based on the granularity of your topology space, for instance if $T_X$
is equipped with discrete topology, then any mapping is continuous,
you have different level of continuous. You can tweak your topological
space $T_X$ to make your function continuous.</p>

<p>Now for one counter example that continuous mapping that is not open
mapping.</p>

<p>$f(x) = 1$ for $x \in R$, the mapping is continuous but not open.</p>
