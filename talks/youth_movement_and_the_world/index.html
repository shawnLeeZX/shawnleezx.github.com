      以零八年金融危机为分水岭，对中国来讲，改革开放以来和平与发展的世界局面正
      逐渐被打破；而对西方世界来说，自文艺复兴以来，推动其文明进程的自由主义和
      个人主义也走到了瓶颈，在环境问题和知识经济的挤压下捉襟见肘地应对又一批民
      粹反移民浪潮。如今世界局面造成有自清朝以来的儒学的认知论困境、自由主义在
      完成对天主神学夺权之后的凝聚力丧失等根本原因，但其最直接的哲学思想和技术
      推动却在极大程度上来自青年建造乌托邦的反抗运动。从某种意义上讲，他们如其
      所望地改变了世界，却不是按他们原来的构想。本作梳理自尼采以来至今的青年运
      动，从而阐释当今失衡世界和青年运动的因果。

    <aside class="notes">
    More than one critic has remarked on the general mood, in the wake of
    Nietzsche, as being in some ways not unlike that among the “counterculture” of
    the 1960s and ’70s (see chapter 22). Martin Green, in his book on the Nietzsche
    generation, concentrates on one noteworthy home, located in the small Swiss
    village of Ascona. There, a remarkable number of feminists, pacifists, literary
    figures, anarchists, modern dancers and Surrealists came together to
    consolidate their radical ideas and initiate certain “life-experiments.” Green
    says Ascona was part-Tolstoyan and part-anarchist, with a decidedly
    naturalist—at times occult—orientation. Among the better-known luminaries who
    passed through were D. H. Lawrence, Franz Kafka, Carl Gustav Jung and Hermann
    Hesse.

    <p>
    However, the most important—and best-established—elements of the Asconan
    idea were its withdrawal from city life （社畜生活） in an effort to establish a “new
    human type,”（生活的新可能性） a post-Christian secular type who expressed a full humanity（充实的人生）,
    and “vagabondage” and dance. [Peter2014, Chp 1]

      No other group that I know of has set out to liberate a technology and
      succeeded. They not only did so against the active disinterest of corporate
      America, their success forced corporate America to adopt their style in the
      end ...
      The quietest of the ’60s sub-subcultures has emerged as the most innovative
      and most powerful—and most suspicious of power. --- Stewart Brand

      people need to look at themselves as self-employed, as vendors
      who come to the company to sell their skills. in at&t, we have to promote
      the concept of the whole work force being contingent, though most of our
      contingent workers are inside our walls. jobs are being replaced by projects
      and fields of work, giving rise to a society that is increasingly ‘jobless but not

      In a 1988 speech at Moscow State University, President Ronald Reagan became one
      of the first to make the case. “In the new economy,” he explained, “human
      invention increasingly makes physical resources obsolete.  We’re breaking
      through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his
      own destiny.”

      Throughout the 1990s, until it was sold in 2001 to the Monitor Group, a
      strategic consulting firm (where it continues today), GBN’s work reversed the
      countercultural antipathy toward industry and the military. In its consulting,
      the same corporate and military institutions that the New Communalists and the
      New Left had condemned became homes to the transformed states of mind and
      leveled bureaucracies that the counterculturalists had worked so hard to
      create. [Fred2006]
