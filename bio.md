This is Shuai Li, or Shawn Lee. I have worked on understanding the human mind from
mathematical principles throughout the past years --- the joint efforts of such
an understanding are commonly known as Artificial Intelligence, or
Cybernetics. It is based on the realization that it might be the key force that
would reshape human civilization in the coming decades. The realization came
from the following past experience.

In a way, I have more or less lived through the new attempts in philosophy of
contemporary societies in the past years. I began with an admiration of hacker
ethics (Pekka Himanen, The Hacker Ethic) and studied Computer Science under the
Special Class for Gifted Young program at University of Science and Technology
of China (USTC). Meanwhile, I was involved in a youth movement that in spirits
was similar with the counter culture in 70s (Fred Turner, From Counterculture
to Cyberculture) but with local characteristics and a much smaller scale, and
was educated in likely the first efforts to introduce the Maker culture to
China through the joint ME310 Innovation and Design program between USTC and
Stanford University (and later the joint MEMSI program between the Hong Kong
Universities and MIT). Upon graduation, I went to Hong Kong to study the
Confucianism legacy there and obtained a Master of Philosophy in Electronic
Engineering at Chinese University of Hong Kong, though I mostly did mathematics
there. I might not need to mention that I have lived in a socialism country
with a massive state meditated commercial sector. Throughout the years, the
research on Artificial Intelligence as an extension of hacker spirits, as
makers' agenda to make the world a better place, as the scientific foundation
of an extension of analytic philosophy, as the next agent of liberating
technology, is the thread that connects the institutes I have involved with,
i.e., USTC, Stanford University, Microsoft Research Asia, Chinese University of
Hong Kong and MIT.

Thorough out all these years, I started to realize the deep philosophical
problem of our contemporary societies resulted from the deconstruction of the
classical philosophy, e.g., Confucianism and Christianity, and the massive
dislocation resulted from the informatization. Tackling the problem requires
an overhaul of both the philosophy and the infrastructure of our
societies. This overhaul is happening at frontiers of many fields. But to put
the philosophy at a solid scientific foundation and to reshape the future
infrastructure, artificial intelligence might be one of the deciding forces.

With an Icarus ideal to work out a mathematical theory of neural networks --- and
a mild depression as a result of the disillusion with the falsehood in all the
propaganda built on the contemporary philosophies --- to initialize the study on
the mathematical principles of the mind with maximally possible academic
freedom, I went back to the Mainland, and took an temporary associate
researcher position at South China University of Technology. That is where I am
staying now.
