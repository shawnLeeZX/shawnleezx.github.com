This is Shuai Li, or Shawn Lee. I study the mathematical principle behind the

study the perception intelligence of the mind by building a theory of

<p>The theory ultimately aims to build a revision of epistemology that serves as
the foundation of a likely new philosophy. The philosophy 1) consists of a
scientific worldview (the result of the revised epistemology) that continues
the project initialized by Renaissance Humanism, the Enlightenment, Logical
Positivism and Analytical Philosophy, 2) a value system that carries on the
Golden Rules from the classic philosophy, e.g., Confucianism and Christianity,
and balances Individual, Community and Ecology (moral and ethnic philosophy),
3) and leads to a meaning of human existence built on the existential
conservatism in Consilience by E. O. Wilson (life philosophy). The philosophy
and the implementation of the computational theory in turn aim to first be the
guide to build an infrastructure, then possibly to prefigure an institution
(public philosophy). The efforts are made to understand human conditions in the
21st century, and are with the challenges of humanities in the 21st century as
the imagined adversary. There are already significant works in the space, e.g.,
Philosophy of Information and <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CYBSPRIN.html">Principia
Cybernetica</a>. I am still making sense
of the possibly ill-formed impression that existing works look rather
ivory-tower, and are of limited real world impact. I am in the progress of
surveying them.</p>

  The essay here is to demonstrate the philosophy that is still under
  development. It is not final, and is under constant revision.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Humans are teleological animals.
    </strong>
    Science has made significant progress in understanding Homo Sapiens.  The
    research until now suggests that humans are teleological animals that are
    guided by instincts to self-perpetuate their genes and memes of their
    cultures. The instincts are not meant in a base way, referring to the base
    instincts of animals, i.e., status protection, violence, sex, food, though
    they are also part of us. The characteristics that are commonly held as
    humane, which I mean love, bravery, righteousness, empathy, rationality,
    are all evolved instincts to serve the teleological purpose of Homo
    Sapiens, i.e., to survive as a species in the biosphere of Earth.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>A civilization is a complex system of which the microscopic units are
      humans, and the order parameter is the available resources, which decides the
      system is in the chaotic regimen, i.e., a jungle, or orderly regimen,
    i.e., a cooperative society.</strong>  Homo Sapiens survive as groups that
    collectively make up complex systems. The systems are what we call
    civilizations. The early-evolved instincts and the later-evolved instincts
    are constantly fighting each other, and reach a dynamic balance, but the
    fighting serves a shared goal, the survival of the genes and cultural
    memes. The early instincts fight to survive with jungle rules, while the
    later instincts achieve survival through cooperation. Which set of
    instincts takes an upper hand determines by whether cooperation achieves a
    better end than competition.
  </p>


  <p>
    <strong>Cooperation or competition is a choice when minimal material
      conditions are met, and Golden rules in the past institutionalized
      cooperation and built great civilizations.</strong> The choice to cooperate, or compete is self-reinforcing
    when all parties can survive under minimal rations. Thus, the key to the
    continuation of human civilization is the continuous efforts to move human
    from the baser instincts to the instincts that are developed in the later
    stage of the evolution, to promote love, empathy, rationality, righteousness,
    goodness, community, curiosity etc. Thus, the key is to institutionalize
    them. Here institution not only means by a set of constitution laws that
      a society works under, but also a system of education that educates
      cooperative humans. The milestone of the development of civilization is the
    institutionalization of community in the form of Confucianism, or
    Christianity. The civilizations that reached this milestone survive to the
    modern age, and the civilization that did not died, or were wiped out.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>A civilization undergoes cycles of prosperity and decline when
      internal cooperation is broken.</strong> Civilization progresses by moving the order parameter away from the
      regimen below the critical threshold where cooperation is not possible as a result of resource
      scarcity. However, the progress are often driven by a small group initially.
      And if the gain is not shared to the whole group timely, the group would split,
      tension would be built, and eventually competition between groups would
      make the civilization deteriorate until cooperation is reached
      again. The cycle characterizes the dynasty cycles in the past,
      or more precisely, the replacement of the ruling class.
  </p>


  <p>
    <strong>Human rights, representative governing and a universal education system avoid the
    prosperity-decline cycle by introducing peaceful internal group
    competition that safeguards cooperation.</strong>
    To avoid such cycles, human rights and its corresponding public philosophy,
    i.e., representative governing, were born to institutionalize that choice
    that the privileged small group, i.e., the ruling class, should not
    suppress the unprivileged group to maintain their ancestors' gain in a
    violent way. A universal education system safeguards that the citizens of
    the civilization are well-informed enough to live the human rights, and
    participate in the representative governing. A constant internal peaceful
    competition thus is introduced in the system to ensure the timely
    replacement of the elites that are not functioning anymore to maintain
    societal cooperation. The replacement does not only refer to the renewal of
    the governments, but also the innovation in technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>It is emphasized that human rights and representative governing
     are hypothesized to safeguards cooperation when the system is already in
     the orderly regimen, it may not be able to move the system to the orderly
     regimen from the chaotic regimen.</strong> This might be why things in
     the developing countries are going badly. The order parameter needs to be
     satisfied for the human rights and representative governing to
     work, which at least should include the alleviation of poverty, a
     well-built infrastructure, and a majority of well-informed
     well-educated citizens.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The constant absorption of the innovation of small sub-groups
    increase the productivity and improve relations of production, and
    maintain the system in a meta-transition phase where the order parameter
    is constantly moving away from the cooperation-impossibility regime. This one
    thing is what we may call progress.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The populism movements in our time are the result of a broken
    internal cooperation.</strong>
    Maintaining the internal cooperation has been the key to the winning of the
    Cold War by the U.S.A. So why things are broken now? The hypothesis on the
    direct cause is that a minority of the system has achieved a destabilizing
    power, not only in the form of capital, but in the form of the knowledge to
    leverage that capital, that gradually broke the internal cooperation that
    aims for common prosperity.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>A democratization of knowledge would bring back the cooperation in
    the current knowledge economy.</strong>
    To prevent the decline, the democracy of the gain by the minority to the
    whole system is the solution. This is not meant to advocate wealth transfer
    in a bad way, but to advocate to democratize the means to achieve that gain by
    spreading knowledge. In the previous age, a minority with an immerse
    power is inevitable since the channel for the transmission of knowledge is
    limited, thus, the ruling class was put to the throne or committee one way
    or another, to meditate the cooperation. Currently, the advent of Internet
    has made the cheap massive transmission of knowledge possible. The thing
    that is missing is the cheap massive guidance. That is what the technique
    of artificial intelligence could do. An wisdom librarian who offers you all
    the information in the world in way that is digestible by your interests.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The democratization knowledge is also the continuation of the
    enlightenment project.</strong>
    The enlightenment was initiated by the printing press, which enables the
    massive dissemination of knowledge and information. In the contemporary
    society, the situation is reversed. It is not the access to information
    that becomes the bottleneck, but the capacity to process it: we are
    drowning in information, but starving for knowledge. Internet has pushed
    the situation to the extreme, and helped build polarized societies — Google
    is powerful on the condition that you ask the right question. If the
    science of learning is worked out, we may build an upgraded version of
    Google Books, or in other words, finish what Google Books set out to be: a
    World Knowledge Organization System (WKOS) that organizes all human
    knowledge, and serves as a guide to everyone who is willing to learn and
    tackle challenges humanity facing, thus offers world-class education to
    everyone, and continues the enlightenment project initiated by the printing
    press, while fixing its errors.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>While the knowledge democratization reworks the infrastructure that
    maintain the material benefits part of order parameter away from the
    chaotic regimen, a deeper task is to rework the philosophy that lead to the
    current broken order parameter.</strong>
  </p>


  <p>
    <strong>Instead of just economical deterioration, contemporary world faces
    a full spectrum of problems.</strong> For anyone who understand the word
    post-modernity, its presence arouses gray melancholy. The contemporary era
    has faced a full spectrum of problems. Culturally, postmodernism resigns to
    the alienation, ephemerality, fragmentation and patent chaos of modern life
    and places individualized aesthetics over science, rationality, politics
    and morality (Harvey, The Condition of Postmodernity). Politically,
    procedural liberalism emphasizes an unencumbered self at the expense of
    self-rule and public goods, and cannot secure the liberty promised (Sandel,
    Democracy’s Discontent). Ecologically, the seeming economical prosperity
    and extravagant lifestyle are overdrawing the energy reserve and creating
    enormous materials wastes, pollution and environmental complications,
    e.g. global warming (Clark, Ariadne’s Thread).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The root of the problems are the result of 500 years’ emancipatory
    struggle away from repressive gods, kings, and states (Öcalan, Manifesto
    for a Democratic Civilization Vol I, II; Giddens, Modernity and
    Self-Identity; Talisse, Democracy After Liberalism), without a substitute
    for the tranquility and the sacred it destroyed.</strong> Underlying the
    facial seeking for rationality and efficiency, the value system of social
    actors is money driven jungle-style competition, inducing “fetishism of
    commodities”, hedonism and nihilism. The collective actions in this complex
    social system guided by such value system created the social economic
    condition that caused the cultural, politic and environmental problems
    debriefed. Terrorism, chauvinism, religion fundamentalism are complications
    of this illness (Castells, Network Society Trilogy). Twenty years ago,
    Jacque judged the western culture is in decadence, for “the loss it faces
    is that of Possibility” in his masterpiece From Dawn to Decadence. Also,
    Castells states in End of Millennial that the key to build a new vibrant
    new society is “by proposing new cultural codes with the potential to
    transform the values of society”.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The ultimate solution is a new philosophy of the 21st century.</strong>
