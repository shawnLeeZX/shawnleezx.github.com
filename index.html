        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
          I have worked on understanding the
          human mind from mathematical principles throughout the past years ---
          the joint efforts of such an understanding are known as Artificial
          Intelligence, Cybernetics, Theoretical Neuroscience, Cognitive Science,
          or Collective Intelligence, depending on who you are asking.
          It is based on the realization that it might be the key force that
          would reshape human civilization in the coming decades. The realization
          came from the following past experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a way, I have more or less lived through the new attempts in philosophy of
          contemporary societies in the past years.
          <ul>
            <li>
              I began with an admiration of hacker ethics (Pekka Himanen, The
              Hacker Ethic) and majored in Computer Science under the Special Class
              for Gifted Young program at University of Science and Technology of
              China (USTC).
            </li>
            <li>
              Meanwhile, I was educated in likely the first efforts to
              introduce the Maker culture to China through the joint ME310
              Innovation and Design program between USTC and Stanford
              University (and later the joint MEMSI program between the Hong
              Kong Universities and MIT), and I was involved in a youth
              movement that in spirits was similar with the counter culture in
              70s (Fred Turner, From Counterculture to Cyberculture) but with
              local characteristics and a much smaller scale.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon graduation, I went to Hong Kong to study the
              Confucianism legacy there and obtained a Master of Philosophy in
              Electronic Engineering at Chinese University of Hong Kong, though I
              mostly did mathematics there. Note that I also have lived in a
              socialism country with a massive state meditated commercial sector.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Throughout the years, the research on the mind as
          <ul>
            <li>an extension of hacker spirits,</li>
            <li>makers' agenda to make the world a better place,</li>
            <li>the scientific foundation of epistemology,</li>
            <li>the next agent of empowering technology,</li>
          </ul>
          is the thread that connects the institutes I have come in contact with,
          i.e., USTC, Stanford University, Microsoft Research Asia, Chinese University of
          Hong Kong and MIT.
        </p>

        
        <p>
          Thorough out all these years, I started to realize the deep
          philosophical problem of our contemporary societies resulted from the
          deconstruction of the classical philosophy, e.g., Confucianism and
          Christianity, without reconstructing a new collective identity that
          binds humanity. The liberty without a sense of purpose and the
          informatization have created massive dislocation across the
          globe. Tackling the problem requires an overhaul of both the philosophy
          and the infrastructure of our societies. This overhaul is happening at
          frontiers of many fields. But the inevitable step to a solution is to identify
          the definition of the problem, and the study of the mind is to study
          the definition of who we are, individually and collectively. The task
          might be better understood by comparing with Freud's invention of
          psychology. However, the task of this time is to build a formal, evidence-backed science
          of the mind that integrates philsophy, (hard) science, and psychology
          to put the philosophy and psychology at a solid
          scientific and mathematical foundation. And further, technologies and
          institutes are to be built to actively reshape societies.
        </p>

        
        <p>
          Upon finishing the study in Hong Kong, I was disappointed with the
          hypocrisy in all the propaganda built on the contemporary philosophies,
          and also the businessization of academics. I figure if I could live
          with the system, I must work on something that really matters. Thus, in
          an Icarian sense, I started to work on the theory of deep neural
          networks by being a quiet research associate at South China University
          of Technology (SCUT).
        </p>

        <p>
          Through almost three years of single-minded work, I started to
          envision a workable path. For miscellaneous reasons, I left SCUT and
          started to work on the theory alone as an intellectual nomad, or an
          independent researcher, depending on how such an endeavor is viewed.
        </p>

  <p>
    I study the mathematical principle behind the mind by building a
    computational theory of the mind.

    <h2>Research Outline</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system"><em>formal
              system</em> </a> of deep neural networks has been built, and is given
          in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12783.pdf"> S. Li (2018)
          </a>. The formal system contains a formal measure-theoretical
          definition, the geometrical/manifold structure of intermediate
          layers, the learning framework, and the optimization properties
          --- i.e., all local minima are global minima with zero risk --- of
          NNs.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <em>contextualization</em> of the formal system is given in [S. Li, 2020, yet to be
          finished] to relate the formal system to the general context of the
          development of science.
          The formal system might appear out-of-place and hard to understand mostly because the
          ideas presented are deep and it is infeasible for now to properly
          present the context for all the ideas involved.  The contextualization expands the section 4 in S. Li (2018), and
          show that the theoretical study of NNs could be considered as an outgrowth of a
          century's progress of the complexity science.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next step is to work on a critically unsolved issue of the
          current deep learning technology that has a large <em>technological
            impact</em> to demonstrate the capabilities of the formal system, because
          the formal system might be interesting for intellectuals, but
          unfortunately not interesting enough for the practical mindsets of
          most of the scientific communities nowadays.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <em>ultimate goal</em> of such an intellectual effort is to continue the
          thousands of years of philosophical quest for understanding. The quest
          is perhaps better presented by quoting Wittgenstein, ‘God does not reveal
          himself in the world. It is not how things are in the world that is mystical,
          but that it exists’ (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus 6.432, 6.44). This is the
          root of all the problems of the 21st century. Without a understanding of who
          we are, and what the universe and our world is, we are left to the
          stone-age instincts and may not survive the Anthropocene.
        </li>
        <li>
          The answer to the existential question would lead to empowering technologies,
          cooperative institutions, and incentive systems maintain the "being" of
          humanity, and still move humanity towards "becoming". But such a
          topic perhaps cannot be fully discussed for the time being, and some
          preliminary notes are given for the interested. To see it,

  <h2>Why a theory of NNs?</h2>

  <p>
  The essay here is to demonstrate the philosophy that is still under
  development. It is not final, and is under continuing revision.
  </p>

  <p>
    The theory ultimately aims to build a version of epistemology that serves as
    the foundation of a likely new philosophy, and lay the intellectual foundation
    that builds the information infrastructure of the 21st century. The philosophy is expected to 1)
    consist of a scientific worldview (the result of the revised epistemology) that
    continues the project initialized by Renaissance Humanism, the Enlightenment,
    Logical Positivism, Analytical Philosophy and Scientific Realism, 2) a value
    system that carries on the Golden Rules from the classic philosophy, e.g.,
    Confucianism and Christianity, and balances Individual, Community and Ecology
    (moral and ethnic philosophy), 3) and leads to a meaning of human existence
    built on the existential conservatism in Consilience by E. O. Wilson (life
    philosophy). The philosophy and the implementation of the computational theory
    in turn aim to first be the guide to build an infrastructure, then possibly to
    prefigure an institution (public philosophy). The efforts are made to
    understand human conditions in the 21st century, and are with the challenges of
    humanities in the 21st century as the imagined adversary. There are already
    significant works in the space, e.g., Philosophy of Information
    and <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CYBSPRIN.html">Principia
      Cybernetica</a>. That is to say, the intellectual foundation of this new
    system of philosophy has been being laid for quite some time, arguably ever
    since from Nietzsche, however, the major pieces that are missing are an
    infrastructure and an incentive system built on this system of
    philosophy. A philosophy provides a vision of good life and good society,
    but to realize it, an infrastructure is needed to support the agent of
    change. The infrastructure and the philosophy combined make
    an <em>incentive system</em> that actively reshapes the civilization --- an
    example of what I mean by the incentive system is the
    <em>Instrument of Expansion</em> introduced in the <em>Evolution of
      Civilizations</em> by Carroll Quigley. The unique capability of A.I. to
      offer perspectives to the philosophy and the infrastructure solution to
      the 21st century makes it very special, and worth working on.
  </p>

  <p>
    An elaboration of the above paragraph is given in the following.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      Humans are teleological animals.
    </strong>
    Science has made significant progress in understanding Homo Sapiens.  The
    research until now suggests that humans are teleological animals that are
    guided by instincts to self-perpetuate their genes and memes of their
    cultures. The instincts are not meant in a base way, referring to the base
    instincts of animals, i.e., status protection, violence, sex, food, though
    they are also part of us. The characteristics that are commonly held as
    humane, which I mean love, bravery, righteousness, empathy, rationality,
    are all evolved instincts to serve the teleological purpose of Homo
    Sapiens, i.e., to survive as a species in the biosphere of Earth.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>A civilization is a complex system of which the microscopic units are
      humans, and the control parameter is the available resources, which decides the
      system is in the chaotic regimen, i.e., a jungle, or orderly regimen,
    i.e., a cooperative society.</strong>  Homo Sapiens survive as groups that
    collectively make up complex systems. The systems are what we call
    civilizations. The early-evolved instincts and the later-evolved instincts
    are constantly fighting each other, and reach a dynamic balance, but the
    fighting serves a shared goal, the survival of the genes and cultural
    memes. The early instincts fight to survive with jungle rules, while the
    later instincts achieve survival through cooperation. Which set of
    instincts takes an upper hand determines by whether cooperation achieves a
    better end than competition.
  </p>


  <p>
    <strong>Cooperation or competition is a choice when minimal material
      conditions are met, and Golden rules in the past institutionalized
      cooperation and built great civilizations.</strong> The choice to cooperate, or compete is self-reinforcing
    when all parties can survive under minimal rations. Thus, the key to the
    continuation of human civilization is the continuous efforts to move human
    from the baser instincts to the instincts that are developed in the later
    stage of the evolution, to promote love, empathy, rationality, righteousness,
    goodness, community, curiosity etc. Thus, the key is to institutionalize
    them. Here institution not only means by a set of constitution laws that
      a society works under, but also a system of education that educates
      cooperative humans. The milestone of the development of civilization is the
    institutionalization of community in the form of Confucianism, or
    Christianity. The civilizations that reached this milestone survive to the
    modern age, and the civilization that did not died, or were wiped out.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>A civilization undergoes cycles of prosperity and decline when
      internal cooperation is broken.</strong> Civilization progresses by
      moving the control parameter away from the regimen below the critical
      threshold where cooperation is not possible as a result of resource
      scarcity. However, the progress are often driven by a small group
      initially.  And if the gain is not shared to the whole group timely, the
      group would split, tension would be built, and eventually competition
      between groups would make the civilization deteriorate until cooperation
      is reached again. The cycle characterizes the dynasty cycles in the past,
      or more precisely, the replacement of the ruling class.
  </p>


  <p>
    <strong>Human rights, representative governing and a universal education system avoid the
    prosperity-decline cycle by introducing peaceful internal group
    competition that safeguards cooperation.</strong>
    To avoid such cycles, human rights and its corresponding public philosophy,
    i.e., representative governing, were born to institutionalize the choice
    that the privileged small group, i.e., the ruling class, should not
    suppress the unprivileged group to maintain their ancestors' gain in a
    violent way. A universal education system safeguards that the citizens of
    the civilization are well-informed enough to live the human rights, and
    participate in the representative governing. A constant internal peaceful
    competition thus is introduced in the system to ensure the timely
    replacement of the elites that are not functioning anymore to maintain
    societal cooperation. The replacement does not only refer to the renewal of
    the governments, but also the innovation in technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>It is emphasized that human rights and representative governing
     are hypothesized to safeguards cooperation when the system is already in
     the orderly regimen, it may not be able to move the system to the orderly
     regimen from the chaotic regimen.</strong> This might be why things in
     the developing countries are going badly. The control parameter needs to be
     satisfied for the human rights and representative governing to
     work, which at least should include the alleviation of poverty, a
     well-built infrastructure, and a majority of well-informed
     well-educated citizens.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The constant absorption of the innovation of small sub-groups
    increase the productivity and improve relations of production, and
    maintain the system in a meta-transition phase where the control parameter
    is constantly moving away from the cooperation-impossibility regime. This one
    thing is what we may call progress.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The populism movements in our time are the result of a broken
    internal cooperation.</strong>
    Maintaining the internal cooperation has been the key to the winning of the
    Cold War by the U.S.A. However, the disappearing of external threats and
    informatization-enabled participation of cheap labors in the developing
    countries gradually corroded the social contract that was established in the
    post-world-war-II era. Such hyper-liberalization splits the once-bound
    social groups, and one of them holds a destabilizing power --- not only in
    the form of capital, but in the form of the knowledge to leverage that
    capital --- that gradually broke the internal cooperation that aims for
    common prosperity. The phenomenon is most salient in the U.S.A., but the
    problem exists in both the developed nations, e.g., U.K. and the emerging
    developing nations, e.g., China, India, Southeast Asia. Canada, Australia
    and the Nordic nations fare better. The situation does not apply to Middle
    East, or Africa, of which the social-economics are still struggling in the
    Middle Age.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The fix to the broken cooperation is multi-faced, and needs an
    overhaul of how matter, energy and information are processed in the
    societies.</strong> A comprehensive account of overhaul is not possible
    here. Instead, some examples are listed. Technologies are agent of
    power and change (cf. Brian Arthur's work on technology as an ecosystem)
    --- though it can lead to both the good and the ugly. 3D print, RISC,
    metal recycling, robotics are reinvention of the infrastructure that
    processes matter. Green energy, electricity cars are reinvention of the
    infrastructure that produces energy. And Internet, computer, artificial
    intelligence, 5G, blockchain are reinvention of the infrastructure that
    process information.

    <strong>A democratization of knowledge would bring back the cooperation in
    the current knowledge economy.</strong> All the agents of change outlined
    previously are knowledge-intensive, and human toils would not matter much
    in the coming decades.  To prevent the decline, the democracy of the gain
    by the minority to the whole system is the key. This is not meant to
    advocate wealth transfer in a bad way, but to advocate to democratize the
    means to achieve that gain by spreading knowledge. In the previous age, a
    minority with an immerse power is inevitable since the channel for the
    transmission of knowledge is limited, thus, the ruling class was put to the
    throne or committee one way or another, to meditate the
    cooperation. Currently, the advent of Internet has made the cheap massive
    transmission of knowledge possible. The thing that is missing is the cheap
    massive guidance. That is what the technique of artificial intelligence
    could do. An wisdom librarian who offers all the information in the world
    in way that is digestible according to ones' interests. However, working
    this out requires nothing less solving the intelligence itself --- to
    provide human-level guidance, we need human-level language capability. The
    language module is a capability of humans that was evolved very recently in
    the geological time. And current technology is nowhere near that
    capability. But I think this is doable. And I will write more about it when
    I finally reach there.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The democratization knowledge is also the continuation of the
    enlightenment project.</strong>
    The enlightenment was initiated by the printing press, which enables the
    massive dissemination of knowledge and information. In the contemporary
    society, the situation is reversed. It is not the access to information
    that becomes the bottleneck, but the capacity to process it: we are
    drowning in information, but starving for knowledge. Internet has pushed
    the situation to the extreme, and helped build polarized societies — Google
    is powerful on the condition that you ask the right question. If the
    science of learning is worked out, we may build an upgraded version of
    Google Books, or in other words, finish what Google Books set out to be: a
    World Knowledge Organization System (WKOS) that organizes all human
    knowledge, and serves as a guide to everyone who is willing to learn and
    tackle challenges humanity facing, thus offers world-class education to
    everyone, and continues the enlightenment project initiated by the printing
    press, while fixing its errors.

    <strong>While the knowledge democratization reworks the infrastructure that
    maintain the material benefits part of control parameter away from the
    chaotic regimen, a deeper task is to rework the philosophy that lead to the
    current broken control parameter.</strong> Infrastructure does not appear on its own. A complex system is
    changed through incentives. To make real change, an incentive is needed to
    make the civilization complex system evolve. The incentive changes the
    behavior of each microscopic unit in the system through individual behavior
    change and feedback loop between units. The cumulative effect of incentives
    would lead to systematical change that ultimately leads to a new phase of
    the system. And that incentive is philosophy.

    <strong>Instead of just economical deterioration, contemporary world faces
    a full spectrum of problems.</strong> For anyone who understand the word
    post-modernity, its presence arouses gray melancholy. The contemporary era
    has faced a full spectrum of problems. Culturally, postmodernism resigns to
    the alienation, ephemerality, fragmentation and patent chaos of modern life
    and places individualized aesthetics over science, rationality, politics
    and morality (Harvey, The Condition of Postmodernity). Politically,
    procedural liberalism emphasizes an unencumbered self at the expense of
    self-rule and public goods, and cannot secure the liberty promised (Sandel,
    Democracy’s Discontent). Ecologically, the seeming economical prosperity
    and extravagant lifestyle are overdrawing the energy reserve and creating
    enormous materials wastes, pollution and environmental complications,
    e.g. global warming (Clark, Ariadne’s Thread).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The root of the problems are the result of 500 years’ emancipatory
    struggle away from repressive gods, kings, and states (Öcalan, Manifesto
    for a Democratic Civilization Vol I, II; Giddens, Modernity and
    Self-Identity; Talisse, Democracy After Liberalism), without a substitute
    for the tranquility and the sacred it destroyed.</strong> Underlying the
    facial seeking for rationality and efficiency, the value system of social
    actors is money driven jungle-style competition, inducing “fetishism of
    commodities”, hedonism and nihilism. The collective actions in this complex
    social system guided by such value system created the social economic
    condition that caused the cultural, politic and environmental problems
    debriefed. Terrorism, chauvinism, religion fundamentalism are complications
    of this illness (Castells, Network Society Trilogy). Twenty years ago,
    Jacque judged the western culture is in decadence, for “the loss it faces
    is that of Possibility” in his masterpiece From Dawn to Decadence. Also,
    Castells states in End of Millennial that the key to build a new vibrant
    new society is “by proposing new cultural codes with the potential to
    transform the values of society”.

    <strong>The ultimate solution is a new philosophy of the 21st
    century,</strong>, which is cursorily described at the beginning.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The combination of the philosophy and infrastructure would make
    an <em>incentive system</em> that would gradually change the civilization
    complex system.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The unique capability of A.I. to offer perspectives to the philosophy and
    the infrastructure solution to the 21st century makes it very special, and
    worth working on.
