<!-- ## Theory of DNNs -->

<!-- In the past six years, I have worked out a theory of NNs. A short introduction -->
<!-- to theory is present in this section --- it is rather technical.  The theory is -->
<!-- divided into the following *four* parts: -->

<!-- -   **S-System**, a formal measure-theoretical framework that builds a -->
<!--     hierarchical hypothesis space, of which NNs are special cases. It is -->
<!--     motivated by the fact that nature is a complex system built -->
<!--     hierarchically, and a mechanism is needed for any agents living in -->
<!--     it to recognize and predict hierarchical events happening. -->

<!-- -   The **geometry** of S-System. The objects in the hypothesis space -->
<!--     are probability measures, thus have an information-geometry -->
<!--     structure. It characterizes the phenomenon that NNs compose and -->
<!--     recompose manifolds that have increasingly high level semantic -->
<!--     meaning. -->

<!-- -   The **learning framework** of S-System. It describes the objective -->
<!--     functions to identify an element of the hypothesis space by learning -->
<!--     the parameters. It gives principled derivation of back propagation, -->
<!--     and unifies supervised learning and unsupervised learning in NNs. -->

<!-- -   The **optimization** landscape of S-System. It identifies principles -->
<!--     and conditions that make the non-convex optimization of the learning -->
<!--     problem of S-System benign; that is, all local minima are global -->
<!--     minima. -->

<!-- The theory is a principle to assign probabilities to events, e.g., predicting the -->
<!-- event that today would be a rainy or sunny day, given past experience. To -->
<!-- recall what a principle to assign probabilities is, we recall the principle of -->
<!-- symmetry, and the law of large number (LLN). The example of the principle of -->
<!-- symmetry is ubiquitous in elementary probability theory, i.e., the equal -->
<!-- probability assigned to the event that front, or back side is obtained when -->
<!-- flipping a coin. So are the law of large number, which assigns normal -->
<!-- probability distribution to that of the mean of a large number of random -->
<!-- variables.  However, the way that these principles assign probabilities grounds -->
<!-- on a certain ensemble of repeated trials: the equal probability assigned to -->
<!-- coin flipping is mostly grounded on the observation on thousands of repeated -->
<!-- trials; and the LLN grounds on averaging repeated trials (with, or without the -->
<!-- i.i.d. assumption). However, how can we assign probabilities to the events that -->
<!-- are not as simple as coin flipping, and is not the average of ensemble, like -->
<!-- the one of weather prediction? -->

<!-- <div id="cloud"> -->
<!-- <figure> -->
<!--     <img src="/images/cirrus6_small.jpg" -->
<!--          height="200" -->
<!--          alt="Cirrus"> -->
<!--     <img src="/images/cumulonimbus3_small.jpg" -->
<!--          height="200" -->
<!--          alt="Cumulonimbus"> -->
<!--      <figcaption>On the left is Cirrus, the type of cloud that normally -->
<!-- wouldn't rain; on the right is the Cumulonimbus, the type of cloud that -->
<!-- normally would lead to -->
<!-- thunderstorms.</figcaption> -->
<!-- </figure> -->
<!-- </div> -->

<!-- Given daily life experience, Cirrus (c.f. left picture) normally -->
<!-- would not rain, but Cumulonimbus (c.f. right picture) would lead -->
<!-- to thunderstorms. The prediction from daily experience comes from -->
<!-- repeatedly observing the cloud shapes and the weather afterwards. The -->
<!-- physics behind the cloud formation and raining is a complex interaction -->
<!-- in the complex system of moisture, dust, gravity, temperature and wind, -->
<!-- of which the outcome is highly chaotic thus uncertain. The past -->
<!-- experience allows us to divide the cloud shapes into different groups by -->
<!-- their salient features that would have a high, or low chance to induce -->
<!-- different types of weather. THUS, in summary, we have a mechanism to -->
<!-- approximate the probability of outcomes of a complex physical system by -->
<!-- observing certain features of the system. That is, to estimate the -->
<!-- plausibility of the raining event based on the events that a certain -->
<!-- group/type of cloud shape occurs. -->

<!-- The theory is a theory of the above mechanism. S-System is the mechanism -->
<!-- to construct feature events, e.g., the shapes of the cloud, that are -->
<!-- divided into groups/types and mirror the hierarchical relationship in -->
<!-- the physical complex system in a self-organized way, e.g., the -->
<!-- interaction between water moleculars and dust particles. The geometry -->
<!-- part characterizes the information geometry structure in the feature -->
<!-- space. The relationship between it and S-System is like the one between -->
<!-- Hilbert Space and functions: it provides a manifold structure. The -->
<!-- learning framework characterizes how the past experience helps learn the -->
<!-- grouping of events: the objective function that divides events into -->
<!-- different cloud types/groups, and discovers feature events in a -->
<!-- self-organized way. The optimization part investigates how such a -->
<!-- grouping is implementable given objective functions in the learning -->
<!-- framework through optimization. They overall make up a theory of NNs -->
<!-- (and S-System): the mechanism to approximate/assign the probability -->
<!-- of/to outcomes of events to estimate the plausibility of events, e.g., -->
<!-- the occurrence of rain or not. -->
