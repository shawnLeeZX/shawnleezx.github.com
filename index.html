<h2 id="theory-of-dnns">Theory of DNNs</h2>

<p>In the past six years, I have worked out a theory of NNs. A short introduction
to theory is present in this section â€” it is rather technical.  The theory is
divided into the following <em>four</em> parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>S-System</strong>, a formal measure-theoretical framework that builds a
hierarchical hypothesis space, of which NNs are special cases. It is
motivated by the fact that nature is a complex system built
hierarchically, and a mechanism is needed for any agents living in
it to recognize and predict hierarchical events happening.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>geometry</strong> of S-System. The objects in the hypothesis space
are probability measures, thus have an information-geometry
structure. It characterizes the phenomenon that NNs compose and
recompose manifolds that have increasingly high level semantic
meaning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>learning framework</strong> of S-System. It describes the objective
functions to identify an element of the hypothesis space by learning
the parameters. It gives principled derivation of back propagation,
and unifies supervised learning and unsupervised learning in NNs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>optimization</strong> landscape of S-System. It identifies principles
and conditions that make the non-convex optimization of the learning
problem of S-System benign; that is, all local minima are global
minima.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The theory is a principle to assign probabilities to events, e.g., predicting the
event that today would be a rainy or sunny day, given past experience. To
recall what a principle to assign probabilities is, we recall the principle of
symmetry, and the law of large number (LLN). The example of the principle of
symmetry is ubiquitous in elementary probability theory, i.e., the equal
probability assigned to the event that front, or back side is obtained when
flipping a coin. So are the law of large number, which assigns normal
probability distribution to that of the mean of a large number of random
variables.  However, the way that these principles assign probabilities grounds
on a certain ensemble of repeated trials: the equal probability assigned to
coin flipping is mostly grounded on the observation on thousands of repeated
trials; and the LLN grounds on averaging repeated trials (with, or without the
i.i.d. assumption). However, how can we assign probabilities to the events that
are not as simple as coin flipping, and is not the average of ensemble, like
the one of weather prediction?</p>

<div id="cloud">
<figure>
    <img src="/images/cirrus6_small.jpg" height="200" alt="Cirrus" />
    <img src="/images/cumulonimbus3_small.jpg" height="200" alt="Cumulonimbus" />
     <figcaption>On the left is Cirrus, the type of cloud that normally
wouldn't rain; on the right is the Cumulonimbus, the type of cloud that
normally would lead to
thunderstorms.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Given daily life experience, Cirrus (c.f. left picture) normally
would not rain, but Cumulonimbus (c.f. right picture) would lead
to thunderstorms. The prediction from daily experience comes from
repeatedly observing the cloud shapes and the weather afterwards. The
physics behind the cloud formation and raining is a complex interaction
in the complex system of moisture, dust, gravity, temperature and wind,
of which the outcome is highly chaotic thus uncertain. The past
experience allows us to divide the cloud shapes into different groups by
their salient features that would have a high, or low chance to induce
different types of weather. THUS, in summary, we have a mechanism to
approximate the probability of outcomes of a complex physical system by
observing certain features of the system. That is, to estimate the
plausibility of the raining event based on the events that a certain
group/type of cloud shape occurs.</p>

<p>The theory is a theory of the above mechanism. S-System is the mechanism
to construct feature events, e.g., the shapes of the cloud, that are
divided into groups/types and mirror the hierarchical relationship in
the physical complex system in a self-organized way, e.g., the
interaction between water moleculars and dust particles. The geometry
part characterizes the information geometry structure in the feature
space. The relationship between it and S-System is like the one between
Hilbert Space and functions: it provides a manifold structure. The
learning framework characterizes how the past experience helps learn the
grouping of events: the objective function that divides events into
different cloud types/groups, and discovers feature events in a
self-organized way. The optimization part investigates how such a
grouping is implementable given objective functions in the learning
framework through optimization. They overall make up a theory of NNs
(and S-System): the mechanism to approximate/assign the probability
of/to outcomes of events to estimate the plausibility of events, e.g.,
the occurrence of rain or not.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-open-for-employment">I Am Open for Employment</h2>

<p>I have spent all my life up to now seeking for a place that is like Invisible
College (IC), Vienna Circle (VC), or Homebrew Computer Club (HCC), but I am not
sure one exists in our time anymore. All existing information gives me the
impression that our time is a dark time: all the previous social engineering
efforts have lost their moment, or proved wrong, e.g., Communism, Fabianism,
Liberalism, Moralism; people have lost the direction to overhaul current
systems that function painfully. In an optimistic look, our time looks like the
time that was at the dawn of Renaissance, when ecnomonic prosperity set the
stage for revolution in ideas. Yet, the philosopher, artists e.g., Desiderius
Erasmus, Martin Luther, Leonardo da Vinci, who renovated the world heroically
were yet to come. The philosophical foundation, and material infrastructure that
support communities like IC, VC, HCC seem not to be ready. I am not in a
position to build one yet.</p>

<p>Thus, I figure I need to have a life after all: I am looking for
employment. The following is <span class="emph">what I can do</span>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you team are considering using Artificial Intelligence in your team, it
is very likely that I can help. I can become an expert in any applied research
area of artificial intelligence given sufficient time (perhaps three
months): the capability and limitation of existing techniques are easy to
guess given the theory background I have, and most applied AI research are
not too much more than engineering tricks after weeding out its theoretical
backbone, so after some trials and errors, I can get them
operational.</li>
  <li>I can get the model/product online quickly (three months perhaps), as long
as the decision about what models to use is made. I programmed a keras-style
neural network package named <a href="http://akid.readthedocs.io">akid</a>
before. It supports Acyclic Directed Computational Graph, Multi-GPU
Computing, Visualization (computation graph, weight filters, feature maps,
and training dynamics statistics), Meta-Syntax to generate network structure
and more.</li>
  <li>I can work on the infrastructure if you have a Tensorflow, or PyTorch style
in-house framework. I am working on a new neural network framework based on
Lisp, C++/CUDA, that uses Lisp as the front end, instead of Python. I am not
that experienced to write a preliminary MXNet in one, or two months yet, but
I have the big picture; it just takes some time to learn the details.</li>
  <li>I can even work as a site reliability engineer. I was an admin at Microsoft
Research Asia before. I am familiar with Cobbler, Chef, Docker. It wonâ€™t
take much time (a month would do) to learn Mesos, Elastic Search, Logstash,
GlusterFS etc. Playing with infrastructure is like playing with Linux; it is
fun.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly, I always want to get a PhD, for research is at least my equal love
w.r.t. hacking. So if any group that is sincerely and seriously working on the
fundamental theory of neural networks can give a hand, I would greatly
appreciate.</p>

<p>You can contact me through email, which can be found in the <a href="/images/nntheory.pdf">manuscript</a>.</p>
