  <p>I would like to work on problems that contributes to the development of the
human civilization. I believe in the positive effects science and technology
bringing to the society, and currently, I work on understanding human
intelligence, building artificial intelligence, and thinking how it could be
converted to technology that empowers people, not authorities. By doing so, I
hope it would contribute to building a global community that has shared
cultural elements, where Chinese culture could be part of it.</p>

<p>This article is about why and how I work on them.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Successfully people always tell the same stories in different ways. If you feel
weird, what I mean by success is the people who take the responsibility of
the authorship of ones’ life. For Confucius, it is the love for the society,
crystallized in form of education; For Xiake Xu, it is the adventitious spirit
to reach for the unknown vast world; For Stephen Chow, it is <q>I once let the
truest love slip away from the front of my eyes, only to find myself regretting
when it was too late</q>; for Hayao Miyazaki, it is the girl flying in the sky,
the symbol of heart, love and Utopian world versus poverty, war and greed; for
Makoto Shinkai, it is unrealized love at the gap of death, distance, or time;
for Tolstoy, it is the turmoil brought to himself, the people and the society
at the transition period of Russian history; for Richard Stallman, it is about
freedom as a way of living and as the born right of people; for Obama, it is
about bridging between different social and political groups, which made him
renounced the default lucrative career of a star student at Harvard. The
stories are not necessarily enjoyable. Most of the time they are not. But perhaps
the suffering is also a source of power, to prevent them from giving in to
ordinary life.</p>

<p>These conflicts are termed existential tension in existentialism (a branch of
philosophy I find to sympathize the most, yet not to have time to study seriously
). The purpose of life in existentialism is to live an authentic life not by
solving the tension but live within it.</p>

<p>The tension of mine has a culture side and a personal side.</p>

<p>Culturally, I want an cure for the society. China has been the only claimed
survival of ancient cultures. It has been the greatest country in the world,
not solely in term of economics, but more so in term of its culture. However,
the hubris developed associated with this greatness finally ruined her. In the
past over 100 years, the people of China has been through the darkest era of
this nation, which perhaps has not been over yet. When I was reading that period of
history, I felt I was stuffed in a can, the emotion could be channeled nowhere.
It is not only because that part of time is sad, but also after all those
struggling, we still are in a trap that I did not know how people could get out
— the totalitarianism that sterilizes the creative, the utilitarianism and
materialism that ruins the fraternity between people, the consumerism that
feeds on people’s animal instincts, and anti-intellectualism that drives true
scientists and innovators away. What’s more amusing, human society seems to
have been through such tragedy in various incarnation in different times, as if
a curse shadows human race.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel intolerable to not have the answer to the question ``what do
I live for?’’. Modern era is the dusk of gods, where human’s life is as
purposeless as the ones of plants and animals. We go to school, learn skills,
and survive in the society, so not to be elimination of the least fit; we are
sexually attracted to, cathect on an opposite sex, get married, and have
offspring, so to have our genes passed on. What all of those for, if anything?
What is life for? We just grow and burn as weeds in the prairie? I do not want
to accept nihilism as the answer.</p>

<p>I cannot remember the exact time that I bit the apple from the tree of
knowledge of good and evil, perhaps starting from high school. Awaking from the
naive childhood, I started to feel I lived in a <em>Matrix</em> like simulation, which
I fought against, and wanted to wake up from. It has been a hell of a dreamy
experience with countless of failures, iterations between illusion and
disillusion, and a mild (or severe, I do not know) depression. After all, I
guess I have waken up, after picking up enough knowledge about the world and
about myself, to the see the mountains are still those mountains, and water
still those water — It is not a simulation; it is life. I (start to) know why
am I living and how am I going to live it.</p>

<p>In the following, I try to write down an outline of the core of these
knowledge, and how they lead to my current version of answers. <q>There is
nothing new under the sun</q>. They are not completely novel, but also not
completely the same with all the philosophers before me. Mostly, what will be
written down are about the development and state-of-the-art of our civilization
and religions, and the future of our civilization and a (personal version of)
religion for modern time.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                                   Youth

                                Samuel Ullman

Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy
cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the
imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs
of life.

Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity of the
appetite, for adventure over the love of ease.  This often exists in a man
of sixty more than a body of twenty.  Nobody grows old merely by a number of
years.  We grow old by deserting our ideals.

Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.
Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.

Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human being's heart the lure of
wonder, the unfailing child-like appetite of what's next, and the joy of the
game of living.  In the center of your heart and my heart there is a
wireless station; so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer,
courage and power from men and from the Infinite, so long are you young.

When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism
and the ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at twenty, but as
long as your aerials are up, to catch the waves of optimism, there is hope
you may die young at eighty.

<h2 id="from-barbarianism-to-civilization">From Barbarianism to Civilization</h2>

<p>For a time, things are good.</p>

<p>I thought all people are good. Politics is a bunch of people sitting in the
citizen piazza and discussing how could they make the world a better place,
through cooperation and with justice. I was a nerd child more taking pleasure in
solitary activities such as reading, writing, playing with computers, hiking and
biking, than enjoying company of people, which makes me too naive about
anything that human factors are involved. Later it turns out politics is more
about how people systematically collect interests and kill each other with a
smile if necessary, than about making the world a better place.</p>

<p>The politics in the highest level in an time is a snapshot of a
civilization. Just as always there are good people who are committed enough to
learn to play the game with the goal to make the world better place, the
development of civilization, studied under the name of history, has been the
records of struggle for the balance between barbarianism and civilization.</p>

<h3 id="first-stage-of-civilization">First stage of civilization</h3>

<p>Human evolved from animals, which makes it always possess certain barbarian
nature — the instinct to survive, the craving for sex, the longing for
companionship, and the desire for dominance (we tag it as power). The aspiration for
money, fame and power essential is the human version survival of the
fitting. You get the larger chance of finding the best opposite sex, improving
your genes and leaving your offspring on the earth. It is only after humans
gain enough sense of security in all of them, or understand those behaviors
enough that they start to behave civilized, instead of manipulated by
instincts. That’s where the idealism and good nature of people start to
flourish. Until then, perhaps humans are not so different from animals.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                          Tolls of Ancient People

I have seen the metal-worker at his task at the mouth of his furnace, with
fingers like a crocodile's. He stank worse than fish-spawn.... The stonemason
finds his work in every kind of hard stone. When he has finished his labors his
arms are worn out, and he sleeps all doubled up until sunrise, His knees and
spine are broken.... The barber shaves from morning till night; he never sits
down except to meals. He hurries from house to house looking for business. He
wears out his arms to fill his stomach, like bees eating their own
honey.... The farmer wars the same clothes for all times. His voice is as
raucous as a crow's. His fingers are always busy, his arms are dried up by the
wind. He takes his rest -- when he does get any rest -- in the mud. If he's in
good health he shares good health with the beasts if he is ill his bed is the
bare earth in the middle if his beasts....
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In this context, we may crisply define civilization as a particular
construction of a specific species, just like ants build their nests. We may
call this the first stage of civilization, a Darwinism where humans play their
version of survival of the fittest. If we stop here, things are not
interesting, since besides survival, no purpose of this species exists. Society
just went through cycles of prosperity and disintegration, stagnated and
trapped. Individuals are cogs in the machine, living mostly for fulfilling
those security checkboxes, growing and burning as weeds in the immerse prairie.</p>

<h3 id="second-stage-of-civilization">Second stage of civilization</h3>

<p>Things become different after the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, where the
struggle of human society was transformed to systematical self-healing instead
of periodical power turmoil. Powers and purpose are supposed to come from each
individual instead of gods or institutes; progress are appreciated; fraternity
between people triumphs over affiliation of institutes or religions. Humans
stepped out of survival games, and started to learn to play the creator’s game,
reflected on faith in art and science instead of gods. Technology started to
transform societies and lives explosively. <q>Economists define modernization
as the process by which humans have increased their control over their physical
environment as a means to increasing per capita output. Sociologists and
anthropologists point out other features of modernization, including the
awakening and activation of the masses, more interest in the present, and the
future than in the past, a tendency to view human affairs as understandable
rather than as manipulated by super natural forces, and, until recent years, a
faith in the beneficence of science and technology.</q> Those pursues are
terrifying for the meek and humble, who reminisces the security and comfort of
the old days. However, for the society, the end result is that it started to
spiral up to an uncertain destiny instead of moving in cycles, though this path
may be self-destruction or leading to grasping the power of the god.</p>

<p>We may call this the second stage of civilization, where we started to renounce
the barbarianism within us to march for an unknown destiny.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>             Enlightenment On Rules of Human Society

Much influenced by the law of gravitation that Newton had demonstrated, the
philosopher believed in the existence of natural laws that regulated, on
only the physical universe, but also human society. Acting on this
assumption, they proceeded to apply reason to all fields in order to
discover the natural laws that operated in each. They subjected everything
-- all persons, all institutions, all traditions -- to the test of
reason. What would be a rigorous ordeal for any society in any period was
particularly unsettling for France's ancient regime, past its prime and
creaking in many joints. Thus the philosopher subjected the old regime in
France, and throughout Europe, to a barrage of devastating criticism. More
important, they evolved a set of revolutionary principles by which they
proposed to effect a wholesale reorganization of society. Of particular
interest to us are their specific proposals in three area -- economics,
religion , and government.

Their key slogan in economics was laissez-fiare -- let the people do what
they will, let nature takes its course. The opposition of government
intervention was a reaction to the rigid regulation of economic life
generally known as mercantilism. In the early period of state building,
mercantilism had been accepted as necessary for national security. But by
the eighteenth century it seems superfluous and damaging. The classic
account laissez-fiare was made by the Scotsman Adam Smith in his famous
work *An inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Walth of
Nations*(1776). He argued that individuals are motivated by self-interest
as far as their economic activities are concerned, that the national
welfare is simply the sum of the individual interests operating in a
nation, and that each man knows his own interest better than does any
statesman.

In religion the key slogan was Ecrasez l'infame -- "crush the infamous
thing," or stamp out religious fanaticism and intolerance. The philosophers
rejected the traditional belief that God controls the universe and
arbitrarily determines the fate of humanity. Instead, they sought a natural
religion that followed the dictates of reason. The outcome was a variety of
radical departures from religious orthodoxy. Some became outright atheists,
denying the existence of God and denouncing religion as a tool of priests
and politicians. Others became agnostics, who neither affirmed nor denied
the existence of God. The majority were deist, willing to go along with
proposition that God existed and had created the universe but insisting
that, after the act of creation, God allowed the universe to function
according to certain natural laws and refrained from intervention. Thus the
deists were able to have their cake and eat it too. They could accept God
and the teaching of Christianity and at the same time reject supernatural
features such as the virgin birth, the resurrection, the divinity of
Christ, and the divine inspiration of the Bible. The important point to
note is that all these new dogmas -- atheism, agnosticism, deism
-- reflected the unprecedented growth of skepticism regarding "revealed" or
"supernatural" religion. For the first time since the triumph of
Christianity in Europe, a definite break had occurred with the Christians
tradition.

In government, also, the philosophers had a key phrase -- "the social
contract." The contract theory of government was not new. The English
political theorist Jon Locke ahd formulated it in his *Essay on Civil
Government* (1690), in which he defined government as a political contract
between rulers and ruled. But the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
transformed it into a social rather than a political contract. For him it
involved an agreement among the people themselves. In his major political
work, *The Social Contract*(1762), Rousseau viewed government as imply a
"commission," by which he justified revolution as a restoration to the
sovereign people of its rightful power.

<h2 id="dusk-of-gods-----existential-crisis-of-modern-human-beings">Dusk Of Gods — existential crisis of modern human beings</h2>

<p>The transition between the first stage and the second stage profoundly
transformed individuals’ lives.</p>

<p>Religions seemed to be like this eternally, ever since there was one. In
pre-modern age, people worshiped totems; they forged their belief as God, and
placed their hope in the next incarnation that they might live a better life by
doing good things in this life or go to heaven in their afterlife, hereafter
living in eternal happiness. Religion provided a community where people could
find their purpose and have a sense of solace and company. The earth was the
center of the universe. Human were specially created by the God.</p>

<p>However, modern discoveries — that earth is yet another small rock in the
enormous universe and that human is yet another mammalian that evolves
according to the survival of the fittest — rocked the foundation of
religions. Though we do not know how possibly organic life could suddenly be
transformed from inorganic molecules, it is at least likely that human was
created by the God the same way as it created animals.</p>

<p>As a Chinese, I should mention another branch of religion, the humanism one
that dominated China, such as Confucianism. Once I believed that there is an
answer in the classics of ancient Chinese books, and was reluctant to find out
it is not the case. Though emphasizing on secular life, it basically functioned
the same as other religions, providing solace, company and comfort. The solace
offered by it lies in family and community. Instead of putting the hope in
afterlife, or the next life, it emphasizes on this life. The destiny of this
belief is not from the gods, but from sages, whose ego boundary expands enough
to take the whole society in. It mostly cares about how to live a happy life
with your family, your friends, your community and your country, and eschews
the question about the purpose of life, the origin of universe, or the
direction of human civilization. Though this looks a lot like the idea
<q>interested in the present</q>, vast majority of people dreaded the present
except for the most privileged class, because life was so hard, as it was in
other civilizations. So China similarly settled in an endless loop of
prosperity and disintegration for thousands of years, till the western
civilization broke its door.</p>

<p>Returning back to the main thread. Together with Renaissance and Enlightenment,
modern discoveries throws human out of the shrine, and let it face the formless
world. It has been horrifying for the most, who choose to believe
whatever they believe in the past, or whatever the first answer they are told
to, or reject to think about the question at all. The disintegration of the old
was not followed by the construction of the new. Atheism, agnosticism and deism
merely demolish an structure without rebuilding it. They also do not touch the most
important function of religion — providing a worldview, a code of conduct,
and a purpose for life. The torch of The Enlightenment was and is being passed on from
generations to generations in search for an new answer. Despite hundreds of
years of efforts, the ultimate answer becomes fragmented, or domain targeted,
or personalized. The social contract of Rousseau aims to solve the complex
relationship between people in the massively scaled up civic
society. Existentialist aims to solve the personal existential crisis by
reducing the problem to individual level. Mostly of those philosophical
construction, which I should learn about to talk about it, become specific
answers to specific problems. It takes great efforts to make a collage of the
big picture. Also, it lacks the community effect provided by past religions.</p>

<p>The situation means no already baked solution is available to one’s
existence. One has to find its own purpose of life.</p>

<p>We may call this the dusk of gods.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                           Dare To Know

Sapere aude, ‘dare to know,’ as Immanuel Kant said in his famous article
‘What is Enlightenment.’ It is true that I am quite convinced that human
beings cannot develop fully if they don’t take responsibility for their minds,
and I also believe that taking such responsibility entails not to shy away
from knowledge like textual criticism of the Bible and evolutionary theory.
It is your choice whether you accept this principle of mine or not.”

<h3 id="the-future-of-chinese-culture">The future Of Chinese culture</h3>

<p>As a Chinese, I am really sad at the past around 150 years’ history of China,
and how our ancient philosophy no longer suits the need of our era. I do not
like current state of Chinese culture. I do not feel a sense of belonging. I
guess that’s why I started all these searching.</p>

<p>One day, after I finished watching the movie <em>The Golden Era</em>, and walked to
have the night meal. Along the passage leading to the front door of the
canteen, around a round table, an Indian, a Caucasian and an Asian were sitting
together. Each of them held a computer, seeming to be discussing some
project. Getting into the canteen, sitting in a table that faces outside, where is the
lake of CUHK, and starting to eat my meal, at the right of my seat were an Asian
girl and a Caucasian. The Asian girl was teaching Chinese to the white boy.</p>

<p>Deja-vu and nostalgia hit me. It felt that I have time traveled hundreds of
years — from the time Confusion, to the Republics of China, to the period the
US counter culture and cyber culture prevailed, to the period of Chinese version of
Gun, Germs and Steel — and across different cultures — the ancient China
where the parental style officials ruled cities, the village governed and
organized by clans and the bleeding, fleeing, struggling, fighting people all over
China in the past over 100 years of chaos; the tech-Utopian hacker culture
of California; and finally the monetary and consumerism modern China.</p>

<p>Which one of them is China? We don’t change as we get older, we just become
more ourselves. When this is not true, we die, perhaps not only
spiritually. The same perhaps holds as well for a culture. When a nation loses
itself, it dies. Perhaps China has died. The 150 years’ struggle perhaps has
killed enough people that makes up the critical mass of this culture.</p>

<p>If this is true, this is sad. But the living has to move on. Along with the
permissiveness, an idea of a recently read book, <em>The Fear of Insignificance</em>,
struck. In a time that people do not live in a single culture, many people in
various cultures around the world are also starting to lose their cultural
identity, and people are measured by net worth. Nihinism seems to become the
logical religion: nothing matters; everything is permitted. The author think
this situation is wrong. He provides an ideological remedy from existentialism:
paring down life to the essentials; become the authorship of one’s own life;
keep an open mind, hold no absolute truth and help raise communities to
preserve human civilization and the planet that supports it.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I started to realize that staying in the old days of local culture is
no longer the future of humanity. The memories of the old China, where teachers
could be fathers, official could be parents, people could die for words, are
selective reminiscence biased toward the good part. It is dated. If it is
going to keep being relevant, it has to be reborn, as a phoenix. It needs to
reorient itself in the context of the global culture instead of the self-centered
geographically isolated once great ancient nation. It needs to become part of a
responsible global citizen that help cure world’s problems, perhaps, first of
all, hers own problems. It is about healing historical scars, and raising
generations of the pure and the shining regardless of social economical
background. It is a long journey. As the old saying goes, <q>tens of years for
trees to grow; hundreds for people</q>.</p>

<h3 id="evolution-of-local-cultures">Evolution of local cultures</h3>

<p>Coming back to the question, “where civilization is going” and “what is our
existence for?”.</p>

<p>Alan Turing said, <q>We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see
plenty there that needs to be done</q>. We evolve as a species. For
generations, we took the torches passed from the previous generation, and passed
it to the next generation. Through this way, our civilization moved forward.
Cultures scattered around the globe are in their own stage, facing problems of
their particular stage, with tens or hundreds of years’ gap between each other.
Some of the culture still uses nationalism as its culture adhesive; some still
is in the empirical totalitarianism stage; some still is in war for unity;
while some embraces liberalism, and starts wondering what it look like to be
space traveling.</p>

<p>We are in the first stage of globalization — the economics-wise
globalization. The most perceivable task ahead of all cultures are the
culture-wise globalization. We need to raise a global community that has mutual
understanding with each other. Wars in the past were most due to ignorant
masses being manipulated by dictators that demonized each other. This is
possible due to the inefficient flow of information that causes insufficient
mutual empathy between different cultures.</p>

<p>For our civilization to move forward, we need to be a global community first,
and raise the awareness of empathy among different cultures. It is about the
time we bind as a species instead of tribes, or in another word, raise
fraternity across cultures. The merge of culture happened again and again in
the history: Hellenic age; Roman empire; European Union. The world is
approaching a global organism, which is both new and old — for the ancient
people, the prairie where most of the tribes live is the world.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                          Culture and Progress

All cultures of all peoples consist of control mechanisms designed to regulate
the behavior of society members. The cultures evolved gradually during the
historical evolution of the societies and therefore represented their survival
wisdom. The values comprising the various cultures were calculated to enhance
community cohesion and survival. Consequently the values commonly incorporated
in cultures favored maximum fertility for species perpetuation, maximum
productivity for economic sustenance, and maximum military strength for
physical survival.

Through the millennia, cultures became the essential underpinnings of their
respective societies. Only through their cultures did individuals know what
they could do and how to do it. Therefore any threat to cultural values
became as serious as any threat to together basic necessities such as food
and water. Hence the extreme reluctance to tolerate any substantive
alternation or modification of traditional values. Hence also the historic
persistence of cultural rigidity, even in periods such as the present, when
rapid technological innovations necessitate correspondingly rapid social
innovations. But technological change customarily has been accepted and
welcomed because it normally raises living standards, while cultural change
has been feared and resisted because it threatens traditional and
comfortable values and practices.

This dichotomy has prevailed throughout history, resulting in the social
stagnation amid the technological storms of our own making. The
disconnection has been responsible for much of the chronic violence and
bloodshed that have stained human history. It persists to the present, when
the disconnection is impacting directly and ominously on many phases of our
lives, as manifested incessantly on television screens and in newspaper
headlines.

</div>

<h3 id="identity-in-the-global-worldview">Identity in the global worldview</h3>

<p>In this global worldview, each local culture has a forward direction, and it
solves the disorientation problem that local culture no longer gives its people
the sense of belong (at least for me).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                               Worldview

Worldviews that give us meaning need to be more than cognitive maps of the
world. They need to generate a sense why life is worth living, and to do so
they must tell us what the ends of life are. Such basic values are what we
experience as sacred. Without such an experience of the sacred, no worldview
can provide the existential mooring that we humans need.  Could there be a
sacred principle common to most members of Homo globalis that could help us
deepen our experience of meaning?  If indeed such a principle could be
formulated, this would accomplish two goals: The first is that as individuals,
we would feel that there is a cause over and above the cultures that we happen
to have been brought up in; we would feel that there is a core to their
worldview that indeed takes them out of the Platonic cave of the belief systems
that each of us has been born into. The second is that Homo globalis might come
to evolve a sense of being part of a global community united by a common sacred
purpose. As we will see, our survival as a species may depend on this
possibility, which I will call the “coalition of open worldviews.”
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Instead of drowning in the good old days, each individual is in a culture which is
in the phase of being reborn. Instead of belong to a dying culture, they belong
to a new global culture that is forming. This new culture has a new sacred
common element that can function as the foundation of a culture, which is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the ideal of human flourishing and the continuation of the human race and
civilization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That could our new identity, and the dawn of a new future.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                           Modern Religion

Homo globalis’s awareness of global interconnectedness may also lead us to form
a coalition with those who want to transcend the tribal past of humanity by
endorsing open worldviews because they enable the type of cooperation that is
needed to save our species. Our access to the huge store of human knowledge and
the technological means to connect to new, possibly global movements may bring
about a victory of reason and humane-ness over bigotry, greed, and
ignorance. Thus the community of Homo globalis will grow daily because of the
spread and ubiquity of communica-tion technology and education.

This coalition may create a world citizenship that goes beyond the glib
worldliness often denoted by “cosmopolitanism.” The charge against
cos-mopolitans has often been that they are just out to raid the globe in
search of gain and have no commitment to any polity.  The world citizenship I
am talking about is of a very different sort. It is based on the realization
that globalization has led to the point where there is no longer a space on
earth that is outside civilization and that political consciousness can no
longer be restricted to one country, culture, or religion and thus needs to
address the fate of humanity as a whole.

In a nutshell my hypothesis is that there are two basic types of
world-views: the open worldview, which accepts that humans can never have
complete and final certainty, and the closed worldview, which claims to
have the ultimate truth and the final solution to all human problems.
Closed worldviews by their very nature are likely to lead to the
catastrophic implications described by existential psychology, whereas open
worldviews are, if not immune, less likely to fall into the fanaticism the
consequences of which we have witnessed for millennia but never more so
than in the bloodiest century of human history.

This experience led Durkheim to his theory of religion, which he expounded most
fully in his classic The Elementary Forms of Religion.  Durkheim’s basic
argument was that the essence of religion was to differentiate between the
extraordinary realm of the sacred and the ordinary realm of the profane. The
sacred was an object, a ritual, or an idea that symbol-ized the social order
and its sublime status.

<h2 id="the-future-of-individuals">The Future Of Individuals</h2>

<p>Previous sections investigate where as a civilization, human species are heading,
and how each individual fits in such a grand picture. However, the most relevant
problem for us, the flesh people, is about what can we do as an individual.</p>

<p>The answer could and should as diverse as possible. The progress of society
needs all kinds of people working on all kinds of issues — education, literature,
philosophy, journalism, politics, business, trading, science, and
technology. Since this is my personal mission statement, the following
describes what I have thought of. It is incomplete, and as I learn more, I
guess I will get more and more operational, realistic versions.</p>

<p>The analysis up to now could be summarized we human as a species has an
ultimate goal — reach for an unknown destiny, perhaps the path to become the
god itself — and a contemporary goal — promote mutual empathy across
cultures of our species, so to achieve the goal of our era for the continuation
of human civilization.</p>

<p>To unearth how those two goals could be possibly achieved, we need to
investigate what propel us towards them. What is the unknown destiny? How could
we promote unity within cultures of our species? The first question is
directional; the second one is executive. To figure out the destiny, I guess we
need to look inward and outward. Looking inward is about understanding more
about ourselves, like what is consciousness. Looking outward is about
understanding more about nature, like what is universe? To promote mutual
empathy across culture, we need to ease the flow of information to let
different people from different cultures know, despite all the difference, they
have the similar suffering, similar dreams, make similar stupid mistakes, and
sometimes are cruel and ignorant similarly. So people from different cultures
know each other’s biases, and do not take each other as threats, but as of the
same kind. Through unity, they can avoid the tragedy of world wars, and face
problems of human race together.</p>

<p>The first part feels like just science. The second part feels like a humanity
problem, but actually it is also a science &amp; technology problem, which is
expedited or impeded by politics. The first one does not much discussion, and
possibly is something I am more able to work on, but this page mostly is not
about it, for two reasons: 1. it is rather academic and I plan to write an
article about it specifically in the future; 2. mostly it is the contemporary
goal that gives people most of the meaning, since the first normally is not
achievable within the life span of a generation.</p>

<p>In the following, the discussion mostly focuses on the second part. The goal
described above has been grand but fuzzy. What does it mean by mutual empathy
across culture and what is continuation of human civilization? Those are
problems, but what is the foe here? What causes those problems? Or what are
those problems?</p>

<h3 id="identify-the-foe-----animal-instincts">Identify the foe — animal instincts</h3>

<p>The story could totally end with identifying the sense of belong as a global
citizen. So we do what a citizen should do, and do what we can to contribute to
the society. Perhaps it should end there, assuming the world never runs into
problems, such as major financial crisis, or conflicts between politic
entities. When those things happen, it would be the time to test how solid the
foundation of a global culture is. It is not the case that everyone see things
the same way: the rich could close their door, enjoy their fancy life and let
the poor outside die on their own; the ruler would segregate its people from
modern civilization, so he could always be the ruler. In all of those cases,
people suffer, not only physically due to lack of materials, but also
spiritually due to lack of anything good to believe, and living in a
dog-eat-dog world. When part of the world runs into problems because certain
delicate balance is being broken, we need faith to restrain us from resorting
to our animal instincts to blame each other, fight with each other, or even
kill each other, and enable us to fight with vested interests rebuild the
broken system, preventing the system entering the poverty state again.</p>

<p>Personally, I was constantly in fear that one day, China’s economy would
collapse suddenly, and my family would have to return to the excruciating days
decades ago. There has been too many sad stories in that time period, and left
too many scars that we try not to reopen. For the past years of my life, most
of my efforts has been on equipping myself, so if one day such thing happens, I
am able to save as much as I can. Not until recently, I bootstrapped enough
economics knowledge, and experience with the society to rationalize the fear by
understanding this complex economic system.</p>

<p>The thing that stands in the way of solving all the potential crises is the
animal instinct of people — to survive, to dominate, and to be the survival
of the fittest — which has been the cause of the eternal struggle in the
history. That’s why humans are doomed; why in most of the eras there are no 
so-called justice; why people are always suffering in one way or another.</p>

<p>At first it seems nothing is wrong here, survival of the fittest, the way how
superior species develops. However, the problem is under the shell of survival
of the fittest is the survival of the evilest, which could lead the
self-destruction of the human race, or even all the living beings on this
planet. Perhaps the most notorious example would be Fascism. As in the America
Caption’s plot, power amplifies both the good and evil side of an
individual. Unfortunately, most people have an evil side. Without check and
balance, even by probability, the evil at certain period of ruling always gets
amplified. Meanwhile, second or later generation of the rich normally do not
aware of the privileged life they are living, and consequently lacks the
awareness and capacity to lead. However, they still want to keep their dominant
positions, so evil things happen. That brings suffering for the whole nation,
or race. I guess that’s the reason why we fight for justice, a ill-defined term
in itself.</p>

<p>In modern time, human race has become an integrated system that made up by billions of
individuals, and under an ecological system. Pure animal instincts in our tribe
time does not serve our purpose now. To move forward to the future for our
race, we have to fight against the instinct that once helps us. So when problem
arises, we have the awareness and capacity to deal with it with wisdom, not
instinct.</p>

<h3 id="power-to-the-people-for-an-utopian-society">Power to the people for an Utopian society</h3>

<p>The fundamental solution is to give power to the people. Not everybody is
interested in power, because power means responsibility. Actually I guess most
of the people who are able to take that responsibility prefer to not doing
so. It is a hard position for a person of conscience. Sometimes, things would
get so wrong that someone has to raise up and fix the system. The society’s job
is to make sure a route is available for people to get the power they want to
make necessary change, no matter it is just for a small community, or the whole
country. Also, it is equally important for people possess enough awareness and
capacity to avoid being easily manipulated by people who is ill-intended. In
this sense, the power to change is better to rephrased as leadership.</p>

<p>What truly separates those in power and the rest are awareness and capacity.</p>

<p>Awareness means wisdom. Awareness roughly could be understood as what the
higher humanism education may teach people. All the discussion of this article
now is an example of awareness. It is the process that I build enough awareness
of the world, so I start to know where I am. It is also about knowing how
democracy work, how autocracy works, or how aristocracy works, or in a word,
how politic system develops and works; about how economics work, like what is
the nature of money; about how largely we are influenced by our
subconsciousness; about how the history develops to its current stage; about
how information is propagated …</p>

<p>Note that the word knowledge is not used, which I think is too neural a term,
and does have a sense of purpose is. We learn much knowledge in school, but
what does those for? Awareness emphasizes a sense of judgment, self-knowledge,
and the wisdom to act upon changes.</p>

<p>Capacity reflects in the most basic elements as in houses and cars to the
decision to decide a nation’s economics policy. People worry about the basic
capacity do not have the capacity to consider the power in the upper level.</p>

<p>In my country, people are yawning for houses and cars. At first, I did not
understand it at all. Then I gradually realize that houses meaning security,
while cars mean mobility. Those two are essentials of a quality life. So a
world people are still striving for living, those two weight heavily on
contributing to people net worth, which in certain degree, reflecting a
person’s capacity. Those are two basic types of capacity — the capacity to have a
place to live in, and the power to move to a place one want to go. While for
me, the sense of security does not come from materials possession, though I
still need them in a basic level. It comes from the sense of mission — as
long as I am working on things I find values in, I do not care too much about
the quality of living condition, as long as it does not drag me back on my
progress. The sense of mobility does not from cars either. It comes from the
confidence (or the aim to build that confidence) to possess valuable skills
that has economic value everywhere.</p>

<p>Institution is the formalized ruled that shaped by long time struggles between
parties of conflicts of interests, and for most of the time in the history,
people are not involved, since they are still struggling with the most basic
form of power. In other word, they do not have the awareness and capacity to
participate in deciding policy, since they do not have the ability to judge
what policy is good or bad.</p>

<p>Awareness gives people to the ability to be self-aware, have a sense of
mission, build a value system, filter information, sense abnormality, and be
kind. Capacity enable people to act upon their awareness, to fulfill their
mission, to right the wrongs, to build communities, to fight corruption, to
improve societal institution, and at last to make a better future. It is then
<q>people are generally good</q> would become true. I guess only on this
condition, human race could reach the Utopian society they want ever since
there is civilizations.</p>

<h3 id="power-to-the-people-through-science-and-technology">Power to the people through science and technology</h3>

<p>To figure out how power could come to people, let’s see what contributes to it
in the history.</p>

<p>The road to leadership is the road to wisdom, knowledge, information and capital
(monetary and human). However, theses four are merely reflection of what is the
core of power instead of power itself. Underlying, it is the awareness and
capacity developed along way to achieve these that matters. To achieve wisdom,
one has to suffer and make many mistakes; to achieve knowledge, one has to
deliberate practice for more then 10000 hours; to achieve information, one has
to learn to extract information from data; to achieve capital (the
first-generation rich), one has to be hard-working, persistent, lucky (so they
know to be grateful), of judgment, frugal, visionary, and has empathy for
people. The more capability one has, the more responsibility one should take.</p>

<p>Due to the lack of effective, cheap means to disseminate those four factors,
only a tiny fraction of population has the chance to develop the awareness and
capacity needed. Those are the kings and nobles. That’s why in pre-modern age,
empirical or aristocracy are the primary institution of society.</p>

<p>With the advance of science and technology, more and more people became
qualified to be in leadership. First, wisdom of Christianity began to widely
disseminate with the help of printing press, which became the precursor of
protestant churches. Knowledge of various disciplines began to disseminate as
well. The advance of navigation techniques, such as ship building, compass
and wheel expedited the dissemination. Windmill and other techniques made
kingdoms be independent of the Roman pope possible in term of economics and
military. So the power passed from the God to people. The accumulation of
science and technology made tremendous change to the infrastructure of people
life. Bit by bit, the accumulated small changes laid the foundation for
upheaval in the upper structure. Human society transformed from monarchism to
democracy gradually, where modern history began.</p>

<p>The trends keep going in modern society. Modern history could be partly seen as
the history of bestowing power to people, or least creating a power grid that
more and more people take part in. Modern education system educates much more
people than priests in the middle age, which disseminates knowledge. Finance
market makes aggregating much money possible only on the basis of superiority
of products or companies, which disseminates capital. Internet makes each
individual has the access to entire human knowledge and possible much more
information compared with the past, which disseminates information. The freedom
to speech, assembly and association makes possible creating communities that
share common values, which makes creating political powers that shape society
possible.</p>

<p>Microscopically, Google map makes it much easier to travel, increases the
mobility of people, which in the end increase the awareness of people; Amazon
scales the book recommendation mechanism, so as long as we could find a seed
book to start with, it is much easier to get into another area; Massive Open
Online Course opens up the best education resources in the world, so even in
the most remote places, people could receive education of the best quality (at
least in term of contents if not best peers, or equipment); Quora makes
aggregating expertise possible, so it is easier to get new knowledge that is
still not summarized; Block chain possibly could build a monetary system that
is not centralized.</p>

<p>All those are based on the infrastructure built called Personal Computer,
Internet, and Smart Phone.</p>

<p>To this end, we see how technology in the history empowers people. So it is
possible for anyone, as long as one tries hard enough, he or she could change
something. Undeniably, history progresses in a complex way, but undeniable,
science and technology play a very important role.</p>

<h3 id="our-torch-of-the-relay-race">Our torch of the relay race</h3>

<p>Science and technology has been equalizing the barrier to explicit knowledge
(not implicit knowledge that has to be learned though apprenticeship), which is
a huge gain to society compared with the ancient time, where knowledge is
restricted to the privileged, though this does completely solve the puzzle that
how an Utopian society could be achieved.</p>

<p>Needless to say, we are not in a Utopian world now. Many people are
suffering. Many nations are suffering. We have many problems: inequality,
bureaucracy, political corruption, environmental problems, existing or looming
financial crisis, aging populations (of certain areas), food safety, so on and
so forth. Most of the people still lack intimate level of information, which is
still passed in form of apprenticeship in the higher society, the financial
means to build upon their primitive prototype and ideas, and the connections
needed to bootstrap a working organization.</p>

<p>But it cannot be solved now does not mean it cannot be solved in future. For
instance, Kickstarter somehow solves the financial mean to bootstrap business,
which is definitely a solution coming from technology. Current state of
technology has given people an unprecedented level of freedom, though it still
cannot bridge the class gap.</p>

<p>However, it should be noticed that the freedom coming in the Information age
does not come for free. We have personal computer, open source operating
system, and a truly distributed interconnected communication network are mainly
because a group of people identified them as hackers that think information
should be free. The dominance of Linux, the creation of GPL license are all
efforts of people, who belong to the intersection of counter-culture and
tech-Utopian.</p>

<p>The change made by technology is a relay race, Each one in a time fixes some
problems, but creates some new ones, moving upward in a spiral way.
Unregularizd, human society always tends to develop towards Dystopia since an
inherent part of us is animal, which is not rational. To reduce the entropy, we
need to keep fighting against it. We still have much to do. We need to figure
out how technology will continue to empower people, and to solve those
problems.</p>

<p>As an example of the fight,
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/whats-our-next-fight">The world of technology starts to centralize again</a>
in form of centralized social network service, cloud platform, or big
data. Those things make computer be like their mainframe ancestor, where we
have to rely on some powerful data center to work.</p>

<p>Phil Windley writes in

<p>Technology is a tool. It is the people who decide what to do with it. Instead

<p>Major changes have happened in the past years, but for its influence to

continue to transform the inter-connection between people and computation,
people and knowledge, people and information, people and people. In the past
half an century or so, we have software in our laptop, apps in our mobiles,
which speeds up workflow; we have instant access to the pool of human knowledge
through Google or perhaps books in e-format; we have been flooded with
information, which not only brings value, but also anxiety; we have social
network, which ups the level socialization to another level. The most important
revolution caused by PC and Internet is the empowerment of individuals and
connection between various entities. Still it is a little unfulfilling.</p>

<h3 id="my-treasure-is-here-and-now">My treasure is here and now</h3>

<p>The analysis up to now mostly is from my personal perspective: who am I, where
did I come from, where am I going?</p>

<p>I am an instance of special kind of species called Homo Sapiens, and a member
of an ancient local culture which is in the process of modernizing itself and
building a global community along with other cultures. I believe in the mission
that our race is reaching for something, and the mission of our contemporary
time is to build a global culture that ensures the continuation of our
race. Due the area of expertise and limitation of up-bring environment,
I believe in the science and technology have a positive role in the process, if
being wielded wisely.</p>

<p>This section is about the last piece of the collection of philosophical
questions: what shall I do?</p>

<p>One major problem of thinkers is that they tend to live in an idealized yet
hallucinated world that only the fundamental philosophical question matters,
which makes them be absent-minded about the real world that mostly of the time is
a dog-eat-dog one. Aristotle basically was taken as crazy person, and was
executed for not being able to deal with human relationship (by asking people
too many provoking questions). He did not understand most of the people in
Athens intentionally chose to not think about those questions. If at the most
of time, a person struggles to scavenge things to eat, one would not care about
anything related to higher culture.</p>

<p>To live authentically life, it is important to get out of the idealized world
and be a realistic idealist. I have been lived in hallucinated world for many
years. It was hell of a revelation to wake up, and saw the world in the view of
the masses, mostly by being exposed repeatedly to various events, intimately
connected with people, getting through countless of failures, and learning
enough about the development of civilizations, more importantly the
state-of-the-art of our civilization.</p>

<p>Despite all those efforts, the key is: what shall I do so I could be realistic?</p>

<p>I found the hint lies in a concept called <em>World</em>. It is true that a worldview
is necessary to the question such as who am I, where do I come from and where
am I going, but people’s action depends on the concept of <em>World</em> that is
rather different from worldview.</p>

<p>Before we discuss what the <em>World</em> is, let’s first see why worldview is
inadequate. Worldview serves as an ultimate direction of life, but to serve as
a daily guidance of life, it misses a very crucial element: the time span of
the development in that direction.</p>

<p>In <em>Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage Esq</em> (1842), Ada
Lovelace wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were
objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those
of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible
of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the
engine … Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched
sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible
of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and
scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It took 100 years to fulfill the vision of Ada Lovelace. The first song, <em>Daisy
Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)</em>, ever played by a computer was at Bell Labs on an
IBM 704 in 1961. It took more time to make it happen in a home-setting like
the Analytical Engine — a hardware hackers named Steve Dompier at Homebrew
meeting made a Altair machine sing Beatles’ <em>The Fool on the Hill</em> with
a program inputted through switch buttons I/O interfaces.</p>

<p>Pioneers are normally too dead to see their visions being fulfilled, because by
definition they are pioneers, not politicians, or entrepreneurs. The explorer
Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama in the Age of
Exploration; Van Gogh was considered a mad man and a failure in his lifetime,
suffering from psychotic episodes and delusions; Alan Turing died in 1954, 16
days before his 42nd birthday, while artificial intelligence became a
technology that started to transform society — the recent resurrection of
neural network — instead of a basic research area (which in many period in
the history was not taken as a serious research area) in 2012. Perhaps the
luckiest type of pioneer is scientists, who delves in a relatively simple
environment, and are told at the time when they enter the field that your
research may only serve as a stepping stone for the next generation, though
nobody belongs to one type or another exclusively, since the best of each kind
is always a blending of some humanist, some artist, and some scientist.</p>

<p>Vision bestows purpose. However, without execution, it is hallucination. The
borderline between genius and mania is like lighting a candle in the darkness
— the further you walk away from the candle, the darker it becomes, but no
sharp cut off line. People need a viable way to live in that vision without
destroying themselves as being an idealist.</p>

<p>It is educational to see into the past, and see the people of that times has
similar confusion about their time, though in retrospect, we know things need
to be tamed with time, and efforts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not ask what we want now; ask what can we do — Lu Xun
<!-- 不要问现在要什么,只要自己能做什么 鲁迅和萧红通信 --></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do
it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. — Howard
Thurman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lu Xun is an influential historic figure in Chinese history who wrote great
literature to awake numb Chinese people around the period of Republic of
China. He lived in the period when China was deep in poverty, wars, political
turmoils, and the ever lasting modernization process. Howard Thurman is a
leading role in many social justice movements and organizations of the
twentieth century mostly for American’s racial problems. They are the types of
pioneers who saw the problems of the society but also worked on concrete
problems instead of merely philosophizing.</p>

<p>The core message in their words is what I mean by <em>World</em>: live in the present,
and act for the perceivable world. We tend to regret on the past, or look
forward to the future, but never really appreciate the present; we tend to take
us as an element of a huge imaginative aggregation called culture, nation or
race, but rarely see the real world is just the place we stay, the people we
touch, the ties we have, and the work we are doing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’ll find your treasure here</p>

  <p>Don’t search in foreign lands</p>

  <p>— Golden Key</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If over simplifying the concept, what matters is your world, the world that is
three miles around you, which expands as you grow stronger. That’s the circle
we are able to influence upon. If we could live our world well, as molecules in
an organism, we have one microscopic healthy cell in a macroscopic
phenomenon. If each one has worked well with her or his existential equation,
and live an authentic life, the entropy of the system will reduce. In another
word, do not take responsibility that overwhelms you.</p>

<p>In an indecent age, or perhaps in doing anything, faith and merely keeping
doing things are more vital than being solely passionate and ambitious.  Human
civilization is a relay race, running to a unknown destiny. So is life — we
eventually die at somewhere, going to somewhere we do not know. So before we
reach the destiny, enjoy the journey. As for the big problems, the patience are
among the most valuable. When facing with problems of societal scale, the first
reaction normally is angry, mostly because the suffering it brings to
oneself. If not contained, it may develop to cynicism. It clouds our judgment
— <q>Never hate your enemies, it clouds your judgment</q>. Only through
patience people could dispel the cloud. (Note patience is not equal to
persistence, which lacks a little wisdom, and may lead to stubbornness). Have
patience and faith for the future, heart for the people, and courage for the
action. Maybe in one generation, their jouney will be stars and universe,
before that happen, we need to keep the torch firing before passing to them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not forget, for there would be echo; Save a breath, and light a candle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coming back to me, personally, I see my mission as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Work on science to answer ultimate questions, and convert it to technology to
empower people if possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is severely under developed, but now I just want the outline
finished. This is an almost lifelong mission. I have much more time to work on
it later.</p>

<p>To say a few more words, the area I mostly interested in is Artificial
intelligence. We have just witnessed a breakthrough in the area — high
dimensional perception problems could be solved in human level with techniques
in artificial intelligence. Though this area is still an empirical science, it
perhaps has opened a very important door to understand intelligence. The thing
is like you are debugging a huge software, with only binary code. The hardest
part is to find one setting that works, so you can know which direction is
wrong and which direction is promising. This ensures we do not move in circles.</p>

<h2 id="ending-----the-golden-era">Ending — The Golden Era</h2>

<p>Ever since Adam and Evan ate the forbidden fruit, human beings have started the
journey whose destiny is unknown. Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I
going? What shall I do?</p>

<p>Mostly, we work by crossing off TODO items in a list. In the past millennia,
the top priority items have been poverty, wars, famine, natural disasters or
plague, while in the modern age, they gradually shifted to consumerism due to
wealth and craving, environmental damaging due to the uncontained power to
shape nature and so on. Not as in the ancient time, where we lived in a place
that people know us for a lifetime, we travel and drift every three or five
years; not as in the ancient time, when we lived in a commune and helped each
other out, we compete globally; not as in the ancient time, we looked up to the
priest and believe they have the answer to everything, we need to figure out
philosophical question ourselves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The optimists proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds; and
pessimist fears it is true. — James Branch Cabell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps they are both right since good or bad are
subjective perception that depends on how do we see the world.</p>

<p>It could be the best of times for personal creativity: we have the financial
system that lets capitals flow to the place where the most productive field is;
we have most convenient media to access the pool of human knowledge, if not
considering the possibility of brain downloading; we have witnessed the
creation and development of the most distributed system ever existed, and the
vast number of non-geologically constrained communities built around it; we
also have access to tools that is able to provide education and career, serve
as portal to the world and the shared culture tie to all cultures in the
global.</p>

<p>It also could be the worst of times to live a comfortable life.  Global scale
competition makes people set on a never-ending journal to climb the social
ladder; the formless world has been shown to human that we possibly are not as
special as we think; information explosion could reinforce personal illusion
since we are increasingly surrounded by the thought-to-be-relevant information
and likely to ignore the existence of black swans; centralization of power,
knowledge, information and force would enlarge the gap between the masses and
the super class if not contained; the speed of development leaves one either
keeping passionate and striving for one’s whole life, or die young spiritually.</p>

<p>Welcome to the golden era. It is the best of times; it is the worst of times
— as it may have been in each era of human race.</p>

<p>Good luck, and may the heart be with you.</p>
