<h3 id="utopian-and-its-infrastructure">Utopian and its infrastructure</h3>

<p>Ever since civilization existed, humans had been longing for a Utopian society,
where people are eternally happy, yet the happiness was a mirage that burst
whenever a definition was attempted. The imagined society has been The Heaven, or Da
Tong in classic age, and Laissez-Faire, or Welfare Society after
Renaissance. Yet, after the thousands years of soul-crushing searching, in our
contemporary society, or in post-modernity, the possibilities of imagining such
a society seems to have ceased to exist, after the demolition of welfare society
since Reagon’s presidency, and the collapse of Soviet Union, though in less
developed areas, e.g., China, the people are still dreaming of the dream the
Westerners dreamed in 18th century, or the dream even in more distance past,
the God’s Heaven.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Oh, Lord, where shall I find my comfort?
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The bust of Utopian dream, is not because of the failure of ideas; it is
because the incomplete of ideas, and the failure of perceiving the complexity
of implementation.</p>

<p>The past ideas have been trapped in reductionism thinking that
one idea would be the ultimate answer for the truth. However, the reality is
that light always is with darkness: it is not the question of absence of
darkness in the heaven, but the question of which of them has an upper
hand. The darkness is built in human nature: we evolved from animals, and they
are our animistic instincts — we kill for a living in the jungles. So are the
light; they are built in human nature as well: we evolved from animals to be a
unique species that is capable of love and morality that facilitate long-term
contract for mutual welfare, and more importantly, social welfare; of rational
thinking that discovers the laws of the universe and checks on the irrational
instincts. The darkness and light form a Tai Ching, blending in a way that
cannot be perceived without acute attentive reflection.</p>
<div id="floated">
    <figure>
    <img src="/images/taiching.png" alt="Tai Ching" />
    <figcaption>Tai Ching</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>The society consists of Homo Sapiens with dual nature is a Tai Ching as well: a
complex system has multiple phases. When the world is rife with violence, the
baser instinct to survive takes an upper hand, so Machiavelli wrote <em>The
Prince</em>; when the world has civil societies consisting of a majority of well
educated middle class people with political awareness and leisure, the rationality and
morality take an upper hand, so Tocqueville wrote <em>Democracy in America</em>; when
world does not have the means to educate the majority of the people, the elite
class that does have access to knowledge forms the aristocrats, priests, royal
families, so we have Catholicism, or Confucianism.</p>

<p>Thus, it is not the statement that all men or women are created equal that
makes the world a happy place. Happiness is not hedonism; it is a serenity
comes after a long, normally excruciating process of practice to know what one
truly desires, based on rationality, morality, and the enjoy of miracle of just
living. Thus, to build a world that consists of happy people in the sense of
the light side of humans, education that is accessible to the majority is an
unavoidable cornerstone, otherwise, at best we would return to the feudal
society in the past.</p>

<p>That is to say, it is not that the institutions, or the ideas that are wrong
— they are partially right, but a lack of infrastructure to build the
precondition on which the ideas can properly function causes the collapse of the
society complex system.</p>

<p>That is to say, we need an infrastructure as cheap as food to provide
world-class education for massive enlightenment. So that the quest for equality
does not become radical destructive populism, and the quest for liberty does
not induce fetish capitalism, but a Tai Ching balance of both.</p>

<!-- There are two aspects of education: the Liberal Arts education and the -->
<!-- professional education. They combined could be called enlightenment. -->

<!-- The Liberal Arts education process consists of interaction between an imagined -->
<!-- outcome based on a preliminary interests, and its temporary results, between -->
<!-- piecemeal assignments and projects and feedback obtained, between questions -->
<!-- arising of confusion and answers to address them. The ultimate outcome is a -->
<!-- wake-up call that shocks one out of slumber that is self-deceitfully taken as -->
<!-- free will, and makes one self-conscious, not only of oneself, but also of the -->
<!-- society at large. -->

<!-- The professional education is the one that equips people with skills, at least to -->
<!-- survive, but more importantly, to solve unknown problems (here is how -->
<!-- professional education bridges to Liberal Arts education). -->

<p>The enlightenment was initiated by the printing press, which enables the
massive dissemination of knowledge and information. In the contemporary
society, the situation is reversed. It is not the access to information that
becomes the bottleneck, but the capacity to process it: we are drowning in
information, but starving for knowledge. Internet has pushed the situation to
the extreme, and helped build polarized societies — Google is powerful on the
condition that you ask the right question. If the science of learning is worked
out, we may build an upgraded version of Google Books, or in other words,
finish what Google Books set out to be: a World Knowledge Organization System
(WKOS) that organizes all human knowledge, and serves as a guide to everyone
who is willing to learn and tackle challenges humanity facing, thus offers
world-class education to everyone, and continues the enlightenment project
initiated by the printing press, while fixing its errors.</p>

<p>That leads to why a theory of artificial neural networks is needed, where we
decode the science of learning.</p>

<p>For how AI relates to WKOS, keep reading the <em>Artificial intelligence and
humanities</em> and <em>Roadmap of future research</em> section of the manuscript.</p>

<p>If you think that our society is functioning very well, read this section.</p>

<p>For anyone who understand the word post-modernity, its presence arouses gray
melancholy. The contemporary era has faced a full spectrum of
problems. Culturally, postmodernism resigns to the alienation, ephemerality,
fragmentation and patent chaos of modern life and places individualized
aesthetics over science, rationality, politics and morality (Harvey, The
Condition of Postmodernity). Politically, procedural liberalism emphasizes an
unencumbered self at the expense of self-rule and public goods, and cannot
secure the liberty promised (Sandel, Democracy’s Discontent). Ecologically, the
seeming economical prosperity and extravagant lifestyle are overdrawing the
energy reserve and creating enormous materials wastes, pollution and
environmental complications, e.g. global warming (Clark, Ariadne’s Thread).</p>

<p>The root of the problems are the result of 500 years’ emancipatory struggle
away from repressive gods, kings, and states (Öcalan, Manifesto for a
Democratic Civilization Vol I, II; Giddens, Modernity and Self-Identity;
Talisse, Democracy After Liberalism), without a substitute for the tranquility
and the sacred it destroyed. Underlying the facial seeking for rationality and
efficiency, the value system of social actors is money driven jungle-style
competition, inducing “fetishism of commodities”, hedonism and nihilism. The
collective actions in this complex social system guided by such value system
created the social economic condition that caused the cultural, politic and
environmental problems debriefed. Terrorism, chauvinism, religion
fundamentalism are complications of this illness (Castells, Network Society
Trilogy). Twenty years ago, Jacque judged the western culture is in decadence,
for “the loss it faces is that of Possibility” in his masterpiece <em>From Dawn to
Decadence</em>. Also, Castells states in <em>End of Millennial</em> that the key to build
a new vibrant new society is “by proposing new cultural codes with the
potential to transform the values of society”.</p>

and humanities</em> section of the manuscript.</p>
