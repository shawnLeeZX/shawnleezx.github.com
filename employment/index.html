  <p>I have spent all my life up to now seeking for a place that is like Invisible
College (IC), Vienna Circle (VC), or Homebrew Computer Club (HCC), but I am not
sure one exists in our time anymore. All existing information gives me the
impression that our time is a dark time: all the previous social engineering
efforts have lost their moments, or proved wrong, e.g., Communism, Fabianism,
Liberalism, Moralism; people have lost the direction to overhaul current
systems that function painfully. In an optimistic look, our time looks like the
time that was at the dawn of Renaissance, when ecnomonic prosperity set the
stage for revolution in ideas. Yet, the philosopher, artists e.g., Desiderius
Erasmus, Martin Luther, Leonardo da Vinci, who renovated the world heroically
were yet to come. The philosophical foundation, and material infrastructure that
support communities like IC, VC, HCC seem not to be ready (if anyone thinks it is
wrong, please do told me, and give me a hint). I am not in a position to build
one yet .</p>

<p>Thus, I figure I need to have a life after all: I am looking for
employment. The following is <span class="emph">what I can do</span>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you team are considering using Artificial Intelligence in your team, it
is very likely that I can help. I can become an expert in any applied research
area of artificial intelligence given sufficient time (perhaps three
months): the capability and limitation of existing techniques are easy to
guess given the theory background I have, and most applied AI research are
not too much more than engineering tricks after weeding out its theoretical
backbone, so after some trials and errors, I can get them
operational.</li>
  <li>I can get the model/product online quickly (three months perhaps), as long
as the decision about what models to use is made. I programmed a keras-style
neural network package named <a href="http://akid.readthedocs.io">akid</a>
before. It supports Acyclic Directed Computational Graph, Multi-GPU
Computing, Visualization (computation graph, weight filters, feature maps,
and training dynamics statistics), Meta-Syntax to generate network structure
and more.</li>
  <li>I can work on the infrastructure if you have a Tensorflow, or PyTorch style
in-house framework. I am working on a new neural network framework based on
Lisp, C++/CUDA, that uses Lisp as the front end, instead of Python. I am not
that experienced to write a preliminary MXNet in one, or two months yet, but
I have the big picture; it just takes some time to learn the details.</li>
  <li>I can even work as a site reliability engineer. I was an admin at Microsoft
Research Asia before. I am familiar with Cobbler, Chef, Docker. It wonâ€™t
take much time (a month would do) to learn Mesos, Elastic Search, Logstash,
GlusterFS etc. Playing with infrastructure is like playing with Linux; it is
fun.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly, I always want to get a PhD, for research is at least my equal love
w.r.t. hacking. So if any group that is sincerely and seriously working on the
fundamental theory of neural networks can give a hand, I would greatly
appreciate. For my past research, refer to <a href="/research_catalog">Research Catalog</a>.</p>

<p>You can contact me through email, which can be found in the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12783">manuscript</a>, or in my <a href="/images/cv.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
